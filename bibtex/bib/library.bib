abstract = {Sequential rotation feeding networks can significantly improve performance of the circularly polarized microstrip antenna array. In this paper, single, double, and multiple series-parallel sequential rotation feeding networks are examined. Compared with conventional parallel feeding structures, these multilevel feeding techniques present reduction of loss, increase of bandwidth, and improvement of radiation pattern and polarization purity. By using corner-truncated square patch as the array element and adopting appropriate level of sequential rotation series-parallel feeding structures as feeding networks, microstrip arrays can generate excellent circular polarization (CP) over a relativelywide frequency band. They can findwide applications in phased array radar and satellite communication systems.},

abstract = {A common frustration among authors using LaTeX to typeset books with significant margin material is that long margin notes often run off the bottom of the page, as shown in Figure 1. Several years ago, Andy Ruina approached me with an idea for solving this problem by completely rewriting LaTeX's margin code, at which point I developed an early version of the marginfix package, the subject of this article. In this article, I'll start by looking in more detail at the problem and some common workarounds. Af- ter this, I'll explain the basic idea behind marginfix's solution. Finally, I'll describe a variety of options allowed by marginfix to further tweak margin note placement.},

One fo the frequency bands being investigated for microspacecraft is the Ka-band (32 GHz), which can be used with smaller equipment and provides a larger bandwidth. This article describes the successfull development of a circularly polarized microstrip array with 28 dBic of gain at 32 GHz. This antenna, which is thin, flat, and small, can be surface-ounted onto the microspacecraft and, hence, takes very little volume and mass of the spacecraft. The challenges in developing this antenna are minimized the antenna's insertion loss and maintaining a reasonable frequency bandwidth.},

abstract = {This report presents a series of studies of deployable structures for future small satellite missions. A spacecraft bus with dimensions of 0.6×0.6×0.8m3 is assumed and the deployable structures are required to fit alongside the bus, in an envelope not exceeding 0.6×0.2×0.8m3. Three types of requirements are considered, as follows: booms for space based GPS ap- plications; 1.5–2 kW solar arrays; X-band (9.65 GHz) SAR's requiring eithera3m diameter parabolic reflector or a 5×1.5m2 planar array. This report presents three novel deployable structures that have been developed to meet these requirements. These structures make use of very recent developments in terms of packaging concepts and self-locking spring hinges, which make it possible to design low-cost structures with low mass. Two schemes for 1.5 kW solar arrays are proposed. The first envisages a 2.4 × 3.0m2 flat array consisting of 15, 0.5 mm thick panels covered with photovoltaic cells. An outline design of this structure, having a fundamental natural frequency of 0.4 Hz and mass of 17.5 kg is developed. The second structure is a concentrator array of similar dimensions, where 10 of the panels are replaced with “cold mirror” panels. A design of this structure is developed, having a fundamental frequency of 0.6 Hz and a mass of 9 kg. Next, a concept fora3m diameter ≈10 GHz parabolic reflector with focal-length-to-diameter ratio of 0.4 is presented. It is based on a tensegrity structure concept where the struts are collapsible and its estimated mass is 9 kg. Finally, a “reflectarray” split SAR is presented consisting of two 2.4×1.6m2 structures that are separately deployed on either side of the spacecraft bus. An outline design of this structure is presented, having a total mass of around 31kg and a fundamental natural frequency of 0.9 Hz.},

abstract = {Works on pico-satellites have gained momentum recently, especially those that consider pico-satellites as part of a much larger constellation or swarm. This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam steering, and wide bandwidth. This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38-patch and 28-slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2U CubeSats. This is because of its small size (34 × 13 mm2) and high gain (7.3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide -10-dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of -15.2 dB.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, more than one hundred CubeSats have been launched, and this number will double very soon. However, the increasing number of launched satellites is not yet followed by an improvement in the communication technology they use: to date, the majority of orbiting CubeSats transmits their data using frequencies allocated in the radio amateur service. If this trend does not change in favor of more advanced technologies, this class of satellites will not be considered a viable solution for commercial purposes, and thus relegated to the role of educational tool or technology demonstrator. The transition to higher frequencies, like those in the Ka band, will enable the design of small and directive antennas, and will make faster data rates attainable. In the nanosatellites development, an antenna can be very demanding in terms of mass and real estate; efficient radiators such as horn antennas or parabolic reflectors in most cases are not viable solutions because of their mass and surface requirements. An ideal antenna should be thin, flat, small, light and designed to be mounted on the outer surface of the spacecraft. In this context, a microstrip array antenna is a convenient solution in terms of size, mass, mounting and cost. In this paper we design a circularly polarized antenna array, with uniform polarization over a wider bandwidth with respect to the bandwidth of the basic array element. In the design of the proposed array, many parameters are subject to optimization: specifically, gain and bandwidth shall be maximized, while the axial ratio and insertion losses shall be minimized. These parameters can be optimized at every stage of the design: for the single patch, the subarray, and the final array. In order to identify the best compromise possible between physical parameters and electromagnetic performances, a multi-objective optimization approach will be adopted. Finally, also the excitations of the elements are optimized following a deterministic algorithm which allows to improve the electromagnetic performances of the uniform array. Numerical results of the consecutive optimization steps will be illustrated.},

This project is carried out by a cooperation between the Departments of Physics and Industrial Engineering and Information Technology of the University of Trieste with the involvement of the Istituto Nazionale di AstroFisica and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare. A few local companies are participating in the project allowing a direct contact between research and industrial field. The main goal is to measure the Earth magnetic field and map the radiation flux. Orbital parameters from a GPS are used to estimate the atmospheric density. An agile mission as AtmoCube can be considered as a precursor of a series of small scientific missions for the analysis of the Earth atmosphere at very low costs and can play a pioneering role in the low-cost probes of the Sun- Atmosphere-Earth system. The project has a strong educational interest: students improve their scientific and technical knowledge by personally designing the satellite sub-systems.

abstract = {A method is presented for generating circularly polarized radiation from an array composed of linearly polarized elements having unique angular and phase arrangements. With this technique the complexity, weight, and RF loss of the array feed can be significantly reduced, especially in a large array. This uniquely formed array has the capability of generating excellent circular polarization (CP) over a relatively wide frequency bandwidth. In addition, the array is capable of scanning its main beam in the principal planes to relatively wide angles from its broadside direction without serious degradation to its CP quality. Another feature of this uniquely arranged array is a reduction in the occurrence of mutual coupling. The discussion in this paper places special emphasis on the microstrip type of radiator, although the technique presented can be adapted to most types of linearly polarized antenna elements.},

Microstrip conformal antennas have distinct advantages in cost, variety of field pattern, and reproducibility for microwave system design. It is felt that similar advantages could be realized at millimeter wave frequencies. The results obtained with actual experimental hardware are described.

At variance of other similar configurations proposed in the past, the one presented in this paper has several important features which can be extremely useful for application in the space environment. In particular, it can be easily fabricated employing suspended technology and its radiation characteristics are to some extent controllable by opportunely varying the geometry. In the following, a straightforward design procedure will be presented detailing the criteria to optimize top and bottom radiating elements. Both numerical and measured results will show that the proposed design satisfies the specifications and presents characteristics comparable to other larger and heavier solutions usually more difficult to design. Specifically, it will be shown that with this configuration it is possible to obtain gain values higher than 12 dB using ground plane of moderate size and that a further improvement up to 15dB can be obtained employing larger ground planes},

The array employs corner-truncated microstrip patches as the basic element, and then a four-element array as the subarray. By applying the sequential rotation technique twice to design the feed networks, a full 64-element array with good performance is obtained. A prototype of the full array was constructed and tested. The measurement results show that both the reflection coefficient of less than 10 dB and axial ratio of less than 3 dB have been achieved over a frequency band of 27-31 GHz; this corresponds to a wide bandwidth of 13.8{\%}. Due to its planar configuration, the proposed array can find good applications in aerospace, radar, and communication systems.},

A cold gas propulsion system is integrated into the vehicle for translational maneuvers. A high performance attitude determination and control system was developed to enable maneuvering and relative pointing. While cost was kept low with the use of commercial off the shelf components and selective redundancy, the integration of new rendezvous and docking components necessitated a significant investment in testing and integrated system performance verification. Approach trajectories remain passively safe through the use of “walking safety ellipses” that include radial and cross track orbital offsets.

abstract = {A new method is presented on constrained power synthesis for reconfigurable arrays of arbitrary geometry. Given a number of suitable masks, the algorithm yields excitation vectors whose array patterns belong to such masks, and for each array element the excitation amplitude holds constant during the pattern reconfiguration, so as to ensure phase-only control. Each excitation amplitude is optimized, and the method allows to control the dynamic range ratio (DRR) of the excitations. The solution to the synthesis problem is found as a point of the intersection between two suitable sets, by using the method of successive projections. The proposed method can also be used to solve problems of constrained beam scanning. To this aim it is sufficient to select a high number of masks, close to each other in the angular sector of interest and shaped in such a way as to reproduce the desired scanning beam. The algorithm yields array patterns belonging to these masks, thus performing a discrete scanning by phase-only control, and allows to control the DRR. Several numerical examples show the effectiveness and the capabilities of the method.},

abstract = {A communications system operating in the 2.4GHz ISM unlicensed band was developed for GeneSat-1, an innovative technology demonstration mission intended to validate the use of research quality instrumentation for in situ biological research and processing. As a key underlying mission-enabling technology, and responding to a low- cost, quick turn-around philosophy, this communications system is based on commercial-of-the-shelf components not originally intended for space flight. The system utilizes a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique widely used in wireless phones, Internet hubs and other devices. This approach provided exceptional benefits relevant to small satellite missions: low cost, highly integrated hardware resulting in small volume, ready commercial availability, plug and play integration, and simple licensing requirements. As a comparison with typical amateur band systems widely used in spacecraft of this class, besides avoiding the restrictions on the nature of the mission, it has the potential for higher throughput and includes security features such as addressing and encryption. Challenges in using this component included the accommodation of Doppler frequency shift, coordinating propagation delays with a time-division multiplexing architecture, and establishing suitable interface requirements for the Earth communication station. GeneSat-1 is a “triple-CubeSat” vehicle launched into LEO in December 2006. Its main mission objectives were successfully achieved during the first few weeks of operation This paper presents a description of the comprehensive analysis and testing produced to attain space qualification and measures of on- orbit performance collected during spacecraft operations, including link availability, effective telemetry throughput and link margin.},

In this paper, a compact single-layer coaxial-probe-fed circularly polarized high-gain patch antenna designed for HORYU-IV nanosatellite S-band communication is presented. HORYU-IV aims to acquire data about high-voltage discharge phenomena in low Earth orbit (LEO). This will enhance the understanding of satellite charging, and overall satellite reliability can be improved for future high-power space programs. The proposed antenna consists of four asymmetric V-shaped slits, i.e., one at each corner of a rectangular patch, and a parasitic rectangular strip. The proposed antenna achieves a sufficient beamwidth for LEO satellite application and less than 3-dB axial ratio for the entire field of view.

For large arrays of closely spaced elements, this gain loss reduces to a negligible amount. However, for spacings above a critical value of about 0.7 wavelengths, unacceptably high gain losses will be incurred.},

By using corner-truncated square patch as the array element and adopting appropriate level of sequential rotation series-parallel feeding structures as feeding networks, microstrip arrays can generate excellent circular polarization (CP) over a relativelywide frequency band. They can findwide applications in phased array radar and satellite communication systems.},

@inproceedings{King2012,
abstract = {Earth observation applications are rapidly being serviced using low-cost small satellites, improving economic and environmental management and creating new markets. The technology driver of this trend is a series of steady improvements in attitude control sensors and microprocessor technologies which have allowed small spacecraft to achieve arc-minute to arc-second pointing capabilities. These advancements have, in turn, enabled high performance and high resolution remote sensing instruments to be deployed on smaller and lower-cost platforms. The constraints placed upon small satellite design for remote sensing missions have traditionally been power availability, heat dissipation and aperture requirements however as small satellite sensor technology approaches the 1 meter resolution threshold, data throughput is becoming a new and particularly challenging constraint on mission design. Ever-improving sensor resolution increases the demand on data transfer in a non-linear fashion even when corresponding improvements in data compression techniques are included. Hence, very small satellites are rapidly becoming data-bound. Approaches to deal with this constraint to date have been based on increased memory size of the payload computer however this does not solve the problem, instead it focuses it. A more pragmatic solution to accessing the vast amounts of data harvested by small satellites in a timely manner is the development of higher speed data downlinks. If small satellites are to satisfy increasing global awareness demands, broadband telemetry links from small satellites will be required. Otherwise missions will ultimately be limited by in-orbit data backlog. The Antarctic Broadband satellite program has developed miniaturized communications technology specifically designed to meet the data transfer requirements of such missions. Funded under the Australia Space Research Program, the project consortium, comprised of industry and research organizations, developed a number of innovative solutions to meet the challenge of transferring data from the South Pole to anywhere on Earth at very high speed. Over the past year, adaptation of this technology to the more general challenge of high-speed Nanosatellite telemetry downlinks has yielded a surprisingly versatile communication system capability. This capability can provide between 60 and 120 Mbps at 1 Watt RF output power to small Earth stations when operating from a standard Nanosatellite platform, such as SFL's Generic Nanosatellite Bus (GNB). This paper describes the system hardware and software architecture developed, the applicability of this new technology to a variety of candidate mission types and the available frequency bands which will support a wide range of mission concepts, including deep space missions. The outcome of applying this state-of-the-art innovation will be a paradigm shift in capability for Nanosat spacecraft and therefore the versatility and value of missions. This new functionality can be incorporated immediately on Nanosats and all larger satellite platforms, enabling new classes of missions for spacecraft of this size. Further size reductions are planned that will even extend this capability to 1U CubeSats.},

@article{Tubbal2015,
abstract = {Works on pico-satellites have gained momentum recently, especially those that consider pico-satellites as part of a much larger constellation or swarm. This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam steering, and wide bandwidth. This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38-patch and 28-slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2U CubeSats. This is because of its small size ( {\$}34times 13{\$}  mm {\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}){\$}  and high gain (7.3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide −10-dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of −15.2 dB.},

abstract = {Nano-satellite platforms, such as cubesats, have recently improved considerably in terms of reliability, and are slowly becoming a financially attractive solution for space exploration missions. As the applications grow more and more complex, a paradigm shift takes place from single cubesat implementation to constellations missions in which the collaboration between multiple satellites is used to execute more difficult tasks. The increased complexity results in a very challenging design process, as the satellites have to meet very strict requirements in terms of orbital dynamics, power budgets and data distribution. The limited available volume in cubesat platforms furthermore drives the need for combining multiple solutions for different types of problems into the same component or subsystem. This paper focuses on integrating communication antennas and photovoltaic cell arrays into a deployable structure that can be used for supplying the required electrical power (by conversion of solar energy), and for establishing a reliable communication link with a base station (BS) on Earth.},

abstract = {The rise of machine-to-machine communications has rekindled interest in random access protocols as a support for a massive number of uncoordinatedly transmitting devices. The legacy ALOHA approach is developed under a collision model, where slots containing collided packets are considered as waste. However, if the common receiver (e.g. base station) is able to store the collision slots and use them in a transmission recovery process based on successive interference cancellation, the design space for access protocols is radically expanded. We present the paradigm of coded random access, in which the structure of the access protocol can be mapped to a structure of an erasure-correcting code defined on a graph. This opens the possibility to use coding theory and tools for designing efficient random access protocols, offering markedly better performance than ALOHA. Several instances of coded random access protocols are described, as well as a case study on how to upgrade a legacy ALOHA system using the ideas of coded random access.},

abstract = {A new method is presented on constrained power synthesis for reconfigurable arrays of arbitrary geometry. Given a number of suitable masks, the algorithm yields excitation vectors whose array patterns belong to such masks, and for each array element the excitation amplitude holds constant during the pattern reconfiguration, so as to ensure phase-only control. Each excitation amplitude is optimized, and the method allows to control the dynamic range ratio (DRR) of the excitations. The solution to the synthesis problem is found as a point of the intersection between two suitable sets, by using the method of successive projections. The proposed method can also be used to solve problems of constrained beam scanning. To this aim it is sufficient to select a high number of masks, close to each other in the angular sector of interest and shaped in such a way as to reproduce the desired scanning beam. The algorithm yields array patterns belonging to these masks, thus performing a discrete scanning by phase-only control, and allows to control the DRR. Several numerical examples show the effectiveness and the capabilities of the method.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the concern of the lack of reliability; efficiency; and power losses of many photovoltaic standalone power supply systems caused by the different elements of the power supply system and varied power ratings. There exists a need for load demand matching with generator output, and the possible variability of the load which introduces further inefficiency was considered. The study involved accurate determination of the energy demand of the load to be powered; in this case a CubeSat ground station with a demand of 240Vac, 13.8Vdc and a current of 30A was used. This energy demand, power budget of the load, the satellite access time and the solar irradiation data were used in mathematical analysis of the ratings of the PV systems elements. The analysed ratings were used to design a circuit, which was used to study the systems behaviour. It was found that the circuit output matched the energy demand of the load rather well. The design implementation of this circuit for any domestic installation will result in more efficient and reliable power supply unit for any specific load.},

One key enabling technology is in the area of battery technology. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of battery technologies suitable for nanosatellites. Several battery chemistries are examined in order to find a type suitable for typical nanosatellite missions. As a baseline mission, we examine York University's 1U CubeSat mission for its power budget and power requirements. Several types of commercially available batteries are examined for their applicability to CubeSat missions. We also describe the procedures and results from a series of environmental tests for a set of Lithium Polymer batteries from two manufacturers.},

abstract = {Solar sailing has long been envisaged as an enabling or disruptive technology. The promise of open-ended missions allows consideration of radically new trajectories and the delivery of spacecraft to previously unreachable or unsustainable observation outposts. A mission catalogue is presented of an extensive range of potential solar sail applications, allowing identification of the key features of missions which are enabled, or significantly enhance, through solar sail propulsion. Through these considerations a solar sail application-pull technology development roadmap is established, using each mission as a technology stepping-stone to the next. Having identified and developed a solar sail application-pull technology development roadmap, this is incorporated into a new vision for solar sailing. The development of new technologies, especially for space applications, is high-risk. The advancement difficulty of low technology readiness level research is typically underestimated due to a lack of recognition of the advancement degree of difficulty scale. Recognising the currently low technology readiness level of traditional solar sailing concepts, along with their high advancement degree of difficulty and a lack of near-term applications a new vision for solar sailing is presented which increases the technology readiness level and reduces the advancement degree of difficulty of solar sailing. Just as the basic principles of solar sailing are not new, they have also been long proven and utilised in spacecraft as a low-risk, high-return limited-capability propulsion system. It is therefore proposed that this significant heritage be used to enable rapid, near-term solar sail future advancement through coupling currently mature solar sail, and other, technologies with current solar sail technology developments. As such the near-term technology readiness level of traditional solar sailing is increased, while simultaneously reducing the advancement degree of difficulty along the solar sail application-pull technology development roadmap.},

abstract = {Earth observation applications are rapidly being serviced using low-cost small satellites, improving economic and environmental management and creating new markets. The technology driver of this trend is a series of steady improvements in attitude control sensors and microprocessor technologies which have allowed small spacecraft to achieve arc-minute to arc-second pointing capabilities. These advancements have, in turn, enabled high performance and high resolution remote sensing instruments to be deployed on smaller and lower-cost platforms. The constraints placed upon small satellite design for remote sensing missions have traditionally been power availability, heat dissipation and aperture requirements however as small satellite sensor technology approaches the 1 meter resolution threshold, data throughput is becoming a new and particularly challenging constraint on mission design. Ever-improving sensor resolution increases the demand on data transfer in a non-linear fashion even when corresponding improvements in data compression techniques are included. Hence, very small satellites are rapidly becoming data-bound. Approaches to deal with this constraint to date have been based on increased memory size of the payload computer however this does not solve the problem, instead it focuses it. A more pragmatic solution to accessing the vast amounts of data harvested by small satellites in a timely manner is the development of higher speed data downlinks. If small satellites are to satisfy increasing global awareness demands, broadband telemetry links from small satellites will be required. Otherwise missions will ultimately be limited by in-orbit data backlog. The Antarctic Broadband satellite program has developed miniaturized communications technology specifically designed to meet the data transfer requirements of such missions. Funded under the Australia Space Research Program, the project consortium, comprised of industry and research organizations, developed a number of innovative solutions to meet the challenge of transferring data from the South Pole to anywhere on Earth at very high speed. Over the past year, adaptation of this technology to the more general challenge of high-speed Nanosatellite telemetry downlinks has yielded a surprisingly versatile communication system capability. This capability can provide between 60 and 120 Mbps at 1 Watt RF output power to small Earth stations when operating from a standard Nanosatellite platform, such as SFL's Generic Nanosatellite Bus (GNB). This paper describes the system hardware and software architecture developed, the applicability of this new technology to a variety of candidate mission types and the available frequency bands which will support a wide range of mission concepts, including deep space missions. The outcome of applying this state-of-the-art innovation will be a paradigm shift in capability for Nanosat spacecraft and therefore the versatility and value of missions. This new functionality can be incorporated immediately on Nanosats and all larger satellite platforms, enabling new classes of missions for spacecraft of this size. Further size reductions are planned that will even extend this capability to 1U CubeSats.},

Among the three orbital regions near the Earth where most catastrophic collisions are predicted to occur, the one corresponding to a sun-synchronous condition is considered the most relevant. Forty-one large rocket bodies orbiting in this belt have been identified as the priority targets for removal. As part of a more comprehensive system engineering solution, a space mission dedicated to the de-orbiting of five rocket bodies per year from this orbital regime has been designed. The selected concept of operations envisages the launch of a satellite carrying a number of de-orbiting devices, such as solid propellant kits. The satellite performs a rendezvous with an identified object and mates with it by means of a robotic arm. A de-orbiting device is attached to the object by means of a second robotic arm, the object is released and the device is activated. The spacecraft travels then to the next target. The present paper shows that an active debris removal mission capable of de-orbiting 35 large objects in 7 years is technically feasible, and the resulting propellant mass budget is compatible with many existing platforms.},

The X-band reflectarray achieved an aperture efficiency of 37{\%}, good radiation patterns, and a total mass of 1.2 kg (excluding the inflation system). The 3 m Ka-band reflectarray achieved a surface flatness of 0.1 mm RMS, good radiation patterns, and a total mass of 12.8 kg (excluding the inflation system).

This paper aims to document these new high-bandwidth systems.},

abstract = {A new concept for increased power extraction for CubeSats is proposed, which is used for HeidelSat. This new concept contains eight expandable panels capable to host additional solar cells for power generation. It is shown how the eight expandable panels are mounted and how they are released after the Launch. Through simulation, the increased power capacity, in comparison to CubeSats without additional panels, is shown. Furthermore, this work shows a maximum power point tracking schema which is used to extract the maximum available power from solar cells. A block diagram for passing the generated power to batteries is also shown as well as a block diagram for voltage conversion and power management that distributes electricity to other systems controlled by the power management system. Also, a discussion about different battery types as well as their advantages and disadvantages and the redundancy of the power system is included. Furthermore the principle of the distributed power management of HeidelSat is explained and the communication system of the power management as well as the monitoring system of the housekeeping data.},

SwissCube will be launch on PSLV in summer 2009. The educational objective of the project is to provide a hands-on experience of the whole development cycles of satellites, and in parallel enhance flexibility, work autonomy and communication skills in a team composed of about 15 laboratories. SwissCube primary science objective is to measure the intensity of the airglow, a thin luminescence layer in the upper atmosphere that emits in near-infrared. For that purpose, a custom made telescope with a CMOS detector was designed. The concept for a low-cost Earth-sensor will also be validated with this telescope. The project built three models (Engineering Qualification Model, Flight Model, and Flight Spare) and extensively tested the EQM. This paper will present the project organization, mission, and satellite description. It will outline the capabilities and performance of the satellite as characterized during the test campaign. Technical as well as programmatic lessons learned will be addressed. Flight results will also be discussed if available.},

This approach leads to throughput substantially higher than the one offered by the traditional slotted ALOHA. In the simplest setting, SIC progresses when a successful decoding occurs for a single user transmission. In this paper we consider a more general setting of a channel with capture and explore how such physical model affects the design of the coded random access protocol. Specifically, we assess the impact of capture effect in Rayleigh fading scenario on the design of SIC-enabled slotted ALOHA schemes. We provide analytical treatment of frameless ALOHA, which is a special case of SIC-enabled ALOHA scheme. We demonstrate both through analytical and simulation results that the capture effect can be very beneficial in terms of achieved throughput.},

abstract = {This paper presents a feasibility study for a very high data rate receiver operating in the K/Ka-band suitable to future Moon exploration missions. The receiver specifications are outlined starting from the mission scenario and from a careful system analysis. The designed architecture uses a low noise front-end to down-convert the incoming K/Ka-band signal into a 3.7 GHz intermediate frequency (IF). For maximum flexibility, a software defined radio (SDR) is adopted for the I/Q demodulation and for the analog to digital conversion (ADC). The decoding operations and the data interface are carried out by a processor based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits. To experimentally verify the above concepts, a preliminary front-end breadboard is implemented, operating between 27.5 and 30 GHz. The breadboard, which uses components off the shelf (COTS) and evaluation boards (EVBs), is characterized by a 46 dB gain, a 3.4 dB noise figure and a {\&}minus; 37 dBm input-referred 1 dB compression point. Finally, a 40 Msym / s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal is demodulated by means of a commercially available SDR, demonstrating the above concept. The importance of these results is that they have been obtained exploiting a class of miniaturized and low cost microwave integrated circuits currently available on the market, opening the way to a dense communication infrastructure on cislunar space.},

The main objective of the project is to provide hands-on experience to students in the design, construction, and control of complete satellite systems that will ultimately serve as the basis for a variety of space experiments. The long-term goal is to use CubeSat missions for scientific experiments.

The key innovative feature of the OUFTI-1 project is to test the D-STAR (Digital Smart Technologies for Amateur Radio) system communication technique of the amateur-radio digital-communication protocol. This means, radio-communication will be used for satellite control and telemetry. The telemetry will be made available to ham-radio operators worldwide. The goal is the space qualification of this new technology so that a functional D-STAR repeater can be given to the amateur radio community. In the future, the D-STAR concept may also be used to control space experiments.

The OUFTI project was initiated in Sept. 2007 when Mr. Luc Halbach, sales manager of Spacebel, proposed to three professors of the University of Li{\`{e}}ge to test a new amateur radio digital technology in space on board of a CubeSat: the D-STAR protocol. It did not even take one month for a team of students and professors to set up around the newborn project.},

The proposed scheme assumes that each user independently accesses the wireless link in each slot with a predefined probability, resulting in a distribution of user transmissions over slots. The operation bears analogy with rateless codes, both in terms of probability distributions as well as to the fact that the ALOHA frame becomes fluid and adapted to the current contention process. Our aim is to optimize the slot access probability in order to achieve rateless-like distributions, focusing both on the maximization of the resolution probability of user transmissions and the throughput of the scheme.},

abstract = {A CubeSat mission to study the impact of flow incidence angle, surface material and surface roughness on gas-surface interactions on spacecraft in low Earth orbits has been designed. To accomplish this scientific goal the CubeSat deploys a variable geometry aerofoil capable of exposing different surfaces to the flow at different incident angles. By using the on-board GPS measurements and an orbit determination technique the drag experienced by the CubeSat can be estimated. The CubeSat has been designed to be part of the QB50 mission, and hence it carries a sensor that can take in-situ measurements of the atmosphere. This is then used to estimate the atmospheric density and hence to extract information on the drag coefficient. To minimise any bias present in the measurement chain a differential approach is used. Therefore no absolute drag coefficients are estimated, instead, ratios of drag coefficients are computed. This allows direct comparisons of the drag coefficients of different materials, different surface roughness or different incident angles. Simulations indicate that this CubeSat mission will be able to obtain drag coefficient ratios with an uncertainty level of less than 5{\%}.},

abstract = {Energetic particles, electrons and protons either directly associated with solar flares or trapped in the terrestrial radiation belt, have a profound space weather impact. A 3U CubeSat mission with a single instrument, the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment (REPTile), has been selected by the National Science Foundation to address fundamental questions pertaining to the relationship between solar flares and energetic particles. These questions include the acceleration and loss mechanisms of outer radiation belt electrons. The Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment operating in a highly inclined low earth orbit, will measure differential fluxes of relativistic electrons in the energy range of 0.5-2.9 MeV and protons in 10-40 MeV. This project is a collaborative effort between the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado, which includes the integration of students, faculty, and professional engineers.},

The sequentially rotated series-parallel stub technique is employed in constructing the feed network to allow symmetrical positioning of microstrip patch elements, resulting in good axial ratio of polarization. In addition, an L-shaped matching branch is used to offer good impedance matching and spatial flexibility for positioning patch elements. Both simulation and measurement results are presented. They agree with each other well and demonstrate much better 3-dB axial-ratio bandwidth and return loss than the single patch antenna.},

abstract = {Started as educational tools, CubeSats have immediately encountered the favor of the scientific community, subsequently becoming viable platforms for research and commercial applications. To ensure competitive data rates, some pioneers have started to explore the usage of the Ka-band beside the conventional amateur radio frequencies. In this context, this study proposes a phased antenna array design for Ka-band downlink operations consisting of 8×8 circularly polarized subarrays of microstrip patches filling one face of a single CubeSat unit. The conceived structure is developed to support 1.5GHz bandwidth and dual-task missions, whose feasibility is verified by proper link budgets. The dual-task operations are enabled by a low-complexity phase-only control algorithm that provides pattern reconfigurability in order to satisfy both orbiting and intersatellite missions, while remaining adherent to the cost-effective CubeSat paradigm.},

abstract = {AtmoCube represents an innovative measurement system for the study of the Earth atmosphere starting from altitude of the order of 600 km. It appears as a cubic nano-satellite that has dimensions of 10×10×10 cm3 with a total weight of 1 kg (aluminium structure). The main scientific instrument is a spectral dosimeter-radiometer allowing continuous monitoring of the radiation environment. The payload includes also a magnetometer belonging to the passive stabilization system. A GPS (Global Positioning System) provides a continuous measurement of the satellite position and allows us to build a map of the measured atmospheric parameters. The goal is to build a precise map of the Earth's magnetic field and of the flux of radiation impinging on the instrument, which is related to space weather effects. The GPS, providing the position of the region where the measurements are performed and the corresponding time instant, allows us to correlate these measurements with other measurements performed on Earth and from space and therefore with the indexes of the solar activity. In addition the GPS allows an indirect measurement of the atmospheric density. It has been decided to use an international platform, CubeSat, a "quasi standard" structure that allows to start from a well consolidated basis. CubeSat is an international program and network that has educative purposes and is already in the production phase in the United States and in Japan. In Norway and Germany the program has started. With AtmoCube, Italy can become an active member of the CubeSat network.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. From 2013 till the end of 2016, more than 552 NanoSats (500 CubeSats among them), weighing less than 10kg, have been launched successfully in total. With the explosive growth of NanoSats/CubeSats, Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of NanoSats/CubeSats has undergone a profound transform and has changed from the initial passive attitude stabilization to active and precise attitude control. This paper summarizes the current state of the art in NanoSats/CubeSats technology for ADCS, based on an available data base of 377 sample ADCS systems from publically reported Nano/CubeSats missions. The advancement of NanoSat/CubeSat missions and their ADCS requirements are first summarized, a discussion on various ADCS sensors, attitude determination algorithms, actuators, and control schemes is then conducted. Further analyses on the various ADCS schemes versus their achievable performances are provided. This survey shows, NanoSat-compatible attitude actuators, miniaturized attitude sensors, GPS receivers and various attitude determination algorithms were widely adopted to achieve different pointing requirements. The reported attitude pointing accuracy has seen a range from being above 10 deg down to below 1 deg (according to different control schemes). Statistics indicates that almost every successfully launched NanoSat/CubeSat employs magnetometer, Sun sensors and magnetic coils; about 23{\%} of the NanoSats/CubeSats had adopted passive attitude control strategies while more than 50{\%} of them had adopted the advanced reaction wheels-based attitude control strategies, which would provide precise pointing.},

abstract = {SNAP-1 is a low-cost nanosatellite build by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), it is amongst other objectives a technology demonstrator for 3-axis stabilisation and orbit control for a future constellation of small satellites during formation flying. The satellite uses a single miniature Y- momentum wheel, 3-axis magnetorquer rods and a single butane gas thruster to ensure a nominal nadir- pointing attitude with full pitch control and in-track delta-V manoeuvrability. The magnetorquer rods do momentum maintenance and nutation damping of the Y-wheel. The primary attitude sensor used, is a miniature 3-axis fluxgate magnetometer. Precise orbital knowledge will be obtained using a small single antenna GPS receiver supported by an on-board orbit estimator. This paper describes the various attitude control modes required to support: 1) a narrow and three wide angle CMOS cameras during pointing and tracking of targets, 2) the propulsion thruster during orbit manoeuvres, 3) the initial attitude acquisition phase and 4) a safe mode backup controller. The specific attitude controllers and estimators used during these modes are explained. Simulation and in-orbit commissioning results will be presented to evaluate the performance and design objectives.},

abstract = {The analogies between successive interference cancellation (SIC) in slotted ALOHA framework and iterative belief-propagation erasure-decoding, established recently, enabled the application of the erasure-coding theory and tools to design random access schemes. This approach leads to throughput substantially higher than the one offered by the traditional slotted ALOHA. In the simplest setting, SIC progresses when a successful decoding occurs for a single user transmission. In this paper we consider a more general setting of a channel with capture and explore how such physical model affects the design of the coded random access protocol. Specifically, we assess the impact of capture effect in Rayleigh fading scenario on the design of SIC-enabled slotted ALOHA schemes. We provide analytical treatment of frameless ALOHA, which is a special case of SIC-enabled ALOHA scheme. We demonstrate both through analytical and simulation results that the capture effect can be very beneficial in terms of achieved throughput.},

This article first summarizes space exploration missions and existing platforms that to-date have been developed by ad hoc, one-of-a-kind cyber-physical integration efforts. The primary goal of this paper is to present a series of cyber-physical systems (CPS) challenges that, if addressed in the emerging science of CPS, will greatly facilitate complex space systems development in the future. Areas of focus include spacecraft communications, driven by relative orbiting network node positions as well as bandwidth and power considerations, attitude control and orbit determination, and space robotics and science payload systems. A strong CPS challenge problem is introduced: scheduling the instructions executed on a small spacecraft processor such that the magnetic field introduced by this processor induces torques favorable for spacecraft pointing.},

Contrary to the conventional methods which use complicated battery modeling, a simple resistor–capacitor battery model was used in order to reduce calculation time and system resource. Modeling errors caused by the simple model are compensated by the sliding mode observer. The structure of the proposed system is simple, but it shows robust control property against modeling errors and uncertainties. The state equation for battery model and the systematic design approach for sliding mode observer also have been presented. The convergence of proposed observer has been proved by the Lyapunov inequality equation and the performance of system has been verified by the sequence of urban dynamometer driving schedule test. The test results show the proposed observer system has robust tracking performance with reduced calculation time under the real driving environments.},

In a second step an electromagnetic interference is injected without contact on these boards, to make sure the different parts of the satellite will not disturb each other. We particularly focus on the susceptibility of the Radio Board (RB), because there is a risk that the antennas pick up some parasitic signals, which will propagate inside the RB.},

abstract = {A compact dyadic diffraction coefficient for electromagnetic waves obliquely incident on a curved edge formed by perfectly conducting curved or plane surfaces is obtained. This diffraction coefficient remains valid in the transition regions adjacent to shadow and reflection boundaries, where the diffraction coefficients of Keller's original theory fail. Our method is based on Keller's method of the canonical problem, which in this case is the perfectly conducting wedge illuminated by plane, cylindrical, conical, and spherical waves. When the proper ray-fixed coordinate system is introduced, the dyadic diffraction coefficient for the wedge is found to be the sum of only two dyads, and it is shown that this is also true for the dyadic diffraction coefficients of higher order edges. One dyad contains the acoustic soft diffraction coefficient; the other dyad contains the acoustic hard diffraction coefficient. The expressions for the acoustic wedge diffraction coefficients contain Fresnel integrals, which ensure that the total field is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries.},

abstract = {CubeSats have proven themselves as a reliable and cost-effective method to perform experiments in space, but they are highly constrained by their specifications and size. One such constraint is the average continuous power, about 5 W, which is available to the typical CubeSat. To improve this constraint, we have developed the eXtendable Solar Array System (XSAS), a deployable solar array prototype in a CubeSat package, which can provide an average 23 W of continuous power. The prototype served as a technology demonstrator for the high risk mechanisms needed to release, deploy, and control the solar array. Aside from this drastic power increase, it is in the integration of each mechanism, their application within the small CubeSat form-factor, and the inherent passive control benefit of the deployed geometry that make XSAS a novel design. In this paper, we discuss the requirements and design process for the XSAS system and mechanical prototype, and provide qualitative and quantitative results from numerical simulations and prototype tests. We also discuss future work, including an upcoming NASA zero-gravity flight campaign, to further improve on XSAS and prepare it for future launch opportunities.},

Although its title sound near to technology terms, concurrent engineering does not miss medicine, ecology, social security and other disciplines. From the methodological viewpoint, concurrent engineering represents a synthesis of a wide spectrum of branches of sciences and technology; that synthesis is primarily stimulated by commercial aspects, supported by the interest coming from production, control of the society and business. But that synthesis leads to a rich process of discovering interdisciplinary relations at the theoretical level, supported by the powerful tools of modern information processing, knowledge representation and exact remote transfer of symbolic, graphic and acoustic information.},

@article{Suhir2013,
abstract = {Application of the consistent, comprehensive and physically meaningful probabilistic design for reliability (PDfR) concept can not only help to understand the physics-of-failure of an electronic product, but, most importantly, can enable one to predict, quantify and assure its failure-free performance in the field. The use of the PDfR concept can be helpful also in the development and implementation of the new generation of the most feasible and effective qualification test (QT) methodologies, practices and specifications. The major ten PDfR requirements (“commandments”) for the predicted, quantified and assured reliability of an electronic or a photonic product could be formulated as follows: (1)PDfR approach is an effective means for improving the state-of-the-art in the field, having in mind that nothing is perfect, and that the difference between an unreliable product and a robust one is “merely” in the level of the never-zero probability of failure (PoF).(2)The best electronic product is, in effect, the best compromise between the needs for its reliability, cost effectiveness and time-to-market (completion) for a particular product and application.(3)Reliability cannot be low, need not be higher than necessary, but, for a cost-effective and a timely product, has to be adequate for a particular product and application.(4)When reliability is imperative, ability to quantify it is a must, especially if optimization is considered: no optimization is possible, of course, if the product's reliability characteristics of interest are not quantified.(5)One cannot design a product with predicted, quantified, optimized and assured reliability by limiting the effort to the highly accelerated life testing (HALT): HALT can test the reliability limits and perhaps to ruggedize the product, but does not quantify reliability.(6)Reliability is conceived at the design stage and should be taken care of, first of all, at this stage, when a “genetically healthy” product is supposed to be created; if the reliability of the product is taken care at this stage, then the subsequent fabrication, qualification and prognostics-and-health-monitoring (PHM) stages will have much better chances to succeed.(7)Reliability evaluations and assurances cannot be delayed until the product is fabricated and shipped to the customer, i.e., cannot be left to the PHM stage: it is too late at this stage to change the design or the materials for improved reliability; that is why, when high reliability is critical (e.g., in the aerospace and military electronics), users have to re-qualify devices to assess their (remaining) useful lifetime (RUL) and to use redundancy in an attempt to build a reliable system out of insufficiently reliable components.(8)Design, fabrication, testing, qualification and PHM efforts should consider, and be specific for, particular products and their most likely actual or at least anticipated applications.(9)Highly cost-effective and highly focused failure oriented accelerated testing (FOAT) geared to a particular pre-determined relevant reliability model and aimed at understanding the physics of failure anticipated by this model is an important constituent part of the PDfR concept and effort.(10)Effective, easy-to-use and physically meaningful predictive modeling (PM) is another important constituent of the PDfR approach; in combination with FOAT, it is a powerful means to carry out meaningful sensitivity analyses (SA), so that the operational reliability of the product is effectively predicted, quantified and assured (“principle of practical confidence”). Analytical (“mathematical”) modeling occupies a special place in the modeling effort, because of its compactness and explicit indication on “what affects what” and what could possibly be done to improve the product's performance. In the write-up that follows the above requirements (“commandments”) are addressed and discussed in detail.},

abstract = {This paper presents a business case for launching a constellation of 6U Solar Power CubeSats (SPCS) to low- Earth orbit (LEO) to provide power to other spacecraft. This approach may prove economically feasible as a business endeavor, as it allows power to be transmitted in a high-density manner via microwave frequencies reducing the collection surface area required on the consumer spacecraft significantly and reducing the requirement for energy storage. Several 6U SPCS units can target their energy streams to form a swath of energy to provide an increased aggregate level of power transfer to a particular craft as it flies though the swath. By separating the solar collection hardware from the consumption, solar cells can be replaced as part of a 6U SPCS replenishment schedule once degradation has rendered them unsuitable for use. The constellation will be arranged so that the orbital customer base is provided with access to power as-needed. This paper presents a model of the economic value provided by a constellation of 6U SPCS which serve as a source of power to orbital spacecraft. In-space activities represent a potentially large market that can perhaps be served by a constellation of 6U SPCS units. Prospective technological innovations that may compete with or be complementary to SPCS are discussed and their impact upon this model is considered. The paper presents a prospective pathway to implementation in the near term, utilizing current technology. The paper concludes by presenting a road map indicating what technologies are required to create economic viability for the 6U SPCS constellation and identifying technologies that would significantly increase service return on investment (ROI).

abstract = {In response to the growing importance of space exploration in future planning, the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Panel on Exploration (PEX) was chartered to provide independent scientific advice to support the development of exploration programs and to safeguard the potential scientific assets of solar system objects. In this report, PEX elaborates a stepwise approach to achieve a new level of space cooperation that can help develop world-wide capabilities in space science and exploration and support a transition that will lead to a global space exploration program. The proposed stepping stones are intended to transcend cross-cultural barriers, leading to the development of technical interfaces and shared legal frameworks and fostering coordination and cooperation on a broad front. Input for this report was drawn from expertise provided by COSPAR Associates within the international community and via the contacts they maintain in various scientific entities. The report provides a summary and synthesis of science roadmaps and recommendations for planetary exploration produced by many national and international working groups, aiming to encourage and exploit synergies among similar programs. While science and technology represent the core and, often, the drivers for space exploration, several other disciplines and their stakeholders (Earth science, space law etc.) should be more robustly interlinked and involved than they have been to date. The report argues that a shared vision is crucial to this linkage, and to providing a direction that enables new countries and stakeholders to join and engage in the overall space exploration effort. Building a basic space technology capacity within a wider range of countries, ensuring new actors in space act responsibly, and increasing public awareness and engagement are concrete steps that can provide a broader interest in space exploration, worldwide, and build a solid basis for program sustainability. By engaging developing countries and emerging space nations in an international space exploration program, it will be possible to create a critical bottom-up support structure to support program continuity in the development and execution of future global space exploration frameworks. With a focus on stepping stones, COSPAR can support a global space exploration program that stimulates scientists in current and emerging spacefaring nations, and that will invite those in developing countries to participate—pursuing research aimed at answering outstanding questions about the origins and evolution of our solar system and life on Earth (and possibly elsewhere). COSPAR, in cooperation with national and international science foundations and space-related organizations, will advocate this stepping stone approach to enhance future cooperative space exploration efforts.},

abstract = {The growing population of space debris poses a serious risk to the future of space flight. To effectively manage the increase of debris in orbit, end-of life disposal has become a key requirement for future missions. This poses a challenge for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) spacecraft which require a large $\Delta$v to re-enter the atmosphere or reach the geostationary graveyard orbit. This paper further explores a passive strategy based on the joint effects of solar radiation pressure and the Earth's oblateness acting on a high area-to-mass-ratio object. The concept was previously presented as an analytical planar model. This paper uses a full 3D model to validate the analytical results numerically for equatorial circular orbits first, then investigating higher inclinations. It is shown that for higher inclinations the initial position of the Sun and right ascension of the ascending node become increasingly important. A region of very low required area-to-mass-ratio is identified in the parameter space of semi-major axis and inclination which occurs for altitudes below 10,000 km.},

abstract = {The exposure to interplanetary radiation poses a serious health risk to astronauts, especially for long-term missions. Protecting the astronauts from these particles has been the key issue to the manned space mission. High-energy space particles can penetrate the protective layer of a spacecraft, and probably cause deleterious effects to the astronauts. To estimate the size of these effects, a credible simulation of radioprotection is required. Using the Geant4 software toolkit, we have modeled the interaction processes and predicted the total energy deposit in a phantom (astronaut) as well as the similar information associated with secondary effects, due to Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) at ∼1 AU caused by the large SEPs events in October 1989 and August 1972. In addition, we compared the characteristics of the energy deposit due to SEPs and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and explained the differences between them by physical mechanism analysis.},

abstract = {The CubeSat Program at Illinois involves designing and building a small satellite. The satellite is made up of several subsystems. One of the subsystems is power. The power subsystem is essential to the CubeSat because it has to properly supply power to the other subsystems in the satellite. The power processing unit (PPU) discussed in this report is designed to meet specifications for supplying power to the micro-cavity discharge (MCD) thrusters on the Illinois CubeSat. The purpose of this project is to efficiently supply the thrusters with a stable AC square wave output in the megahertz range. Weight had to be considered such that the circuit does not exceed 30 grams. The PPU design uses a voltage source inverter (VSI) configuration to generate the desired signal.},

Two different solutions to the problem were developed, namely Linear Quadratic Regulator and No Wheel controllers. Their aptitude to achieve the required performance was confirmed by multiple numerical simulations under different initial conditions and various scenarios. The new algorithms were tested onboard the Israeli Gurwin-TechSAT micro-satellite, nominally momentum-biased, stabilized within 2–2.5 precision by the proportion-plus-derivative magnetic controller. In the flight tests of the new controllers, some valuable results were obtained, such as revealing the possibility to effectively maintain the satellite 3-axis stabilization even with a very small momentum bias, and the implementation and efficient performance of the properly modified extended and linear Kalman filters in the onboard computer.},

abstract = {Millimeter-wave communication achieves multi-Gbps data rates via highly directional beamforming to overcome pathloss and provide the desired SNR. Unfortunately, establishing communication with sufficiently narrow beamwidth to obtain the necessary link budget is a high overhead procedure in which the search space scales with device mobility and the product of the sender-receiver beam resolution. In this paper, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate Blind Beam Steering (BBS) a novel architecture and algorithm that removes in-band overhead for directional mm-Wave link establishment. Our system architecture couples mm-Wave and legacy 2.4/5 GHz bands using out-of-band direction inference to establish (overhead-free) multi-Gbps mm-Wave communication. Further, BBS evaluates direction estimates retrieved from passively overheard 2.4/5 GHz frames to assure highest mm-Wave link quality on unobstructed direct paths. By removing in-band overhead, we leverage mm-Wave's very high throughput capabilities, beam-width scalability and provide robustness to mobility. We demonstrate that BBS achieves 97.8{\%} accuracy estimating direction between pairing nodes using at least 5 detection band antennas. Further, BBS successfully detects unobstructed direct path conditions with an accuracy of 96.5{\%} and reduces the IEEE 802.11ad beamforming training overhead by 81{\%}.},

Countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are creating or reinvigorating national satellite programs. These countries are building local capability in space through technological learning. This paper analyzes implementation approaches in small satellite programs within developing countries. The study addresses diverse examples of approaches used to master, adapt, diffuse and apply satellite technology in emerging countries. The work focuses on government programs that represent the nation and deliver services that provide public goods such as environmental monitoring. An original framework developed by the authors examines implementation approaches and contextual factors using the concept of Systems Architecture. The Systems Architecture analysis defines the satellite programs as systems within a context which execute functions via forms in order to achieve stakeholder objectives. These Systems Architecture definitions are applied to case studies of six satellite projects executed by countries in Africa and Asia. The architectural models used by these countries in various projects reveal patterns in the areas of training, technical specifications and partnership style. Based on these patterns, three Archetypal Project Architectures are defined which link the contextual factors to the implementation approaches. The three Archetypal Project Architectures lead to distinct opportunities for training, capability building and end user services.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that concurrent transmissions can help boost wireless network performance despite the possibility of packet collisions. However, while these works provide empirical evidence that concurrent transmissions may be received reliably, existing signal capture models only partially explain the root causes of this phenomenon. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for MSK-modulated signals that makes the reasons explicit and thus provides fundamental insights into the key parameters governing the successful reception of colliding transmissions. A major contribution is the closed-form derivation of the receiver bit decision variable for an arbitrary number of colliding signals and constellations of power ratios, time offsets, and carrier phase offsets. We systematically explore the factors for successful packet delivery under concurrent transmissions across the whole parameter space of the model. We confirm the capture threshold behavior observed in previous studies but also reveal new insights relevant to the design of optimal protocols. We identify capture zones depending not only on the signal power ratio but also on time and phase offsets.},

abstract = {Nano-satellites have a cost advantage due to their low mass and usage of commercial-off-the-shelf technologies. However, the low mass also restricts the functionality of a nano-satellite's payload. Typically, this would imply instruments with very low to low resolution and accuracy, essentially ruling out applications such as remote sensing. However, multiple nano-satellites can cooperate to improve the overall system performance, for example by increasing the frequency of the observations. The objective of this study is to design a radar system that can be accommodated in a nano-satellite, and investigate the feasibility of using multiples of these nano-satellites to perform high temporal resolution remote sensing. In this paper therefore, the concept of a nano-satellite sized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Nano-SAR) is investigated. Nano-satellites have very constrained power and volume budgets, and there are limits to how much surface area they can unfold for use in radar. Given these constraints, a SAR system for use in a nano-satellite in a 350 km orbit was sized, and approaches to tackle the deficits in the radar link budget are proposed. When applying state-of-the-art technologies, both on the component level, as well as on an architectural level, one arrives at a closed link budget. The proposed radar system consists of a patch antenna array with a span of 1.14 m by 0.18 m, operating at a frequency of 5.8 GHz. Power amplification and phase shifting is performed on the panel, using digital radio frequency (RF) integrated Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. This results in a swath width of 60 km, with pixel sizes of 10 m in elevation direction. Given these performance values, coupled with the increased revisit times, it was obvious this radar, when flown in a larger swarm of nano-satellites, would allow faster now-casting for weather prediction. With significant investment in technology development, it could be possible to use this system for SAR interferometry, for near-real-time monitoring of fast ground deformation phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanoes. Other applications could lie in the field of near-real-time ship motion detection and oil spill spread detection. Many technical challenges need to be solved still and platforms need to be designed, capable of supporting this system, before this payload would be ready for deployment. Preliminary design suggests the cost of such an instrument is substantially higher than what is common for nano-satellite components. However, the potential of such a system is extremely promising, and merits further investigation.},

Another approach, which has a fundamental potential in not only eliminating near/far effects but also in substantially raising the capacity, is multiuser detection and interference cancellation. Various optimal and suboptimal schemes have been investigated. Most of these schemes, however, get too complex even for relatively simple systems and rely on good channel estimates. For interference cancellation, estimation of channel parameters (viz. received amplitude and phase) is important. We analyze a simple successive interference cancellation scheme for coherent BPSK modulation, where the parameter estimation is done using the output of a linear correlator. We then extend the analysis for a noncoherent modulation scheme, namely M-ary orthogonal modulation. For the noncoherent case, the needed information on both the amplitude and phase is obtained from the correlator output. The performance of the IC scheme along with multipath diversity combining is studied},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to integrate safety-engineered devices into outpatient fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the thyroid in an interventional radiology practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The practice center is a tertiary referral center for image-directed FNA thyroid biopsies in difficult patients referred by the primary care physician, endocrinologist, or otolaryngologist. As a departmental quality of care and safety improvement program, we instituted integration of safety devices into our thyroid biopsy procedures and determined the effect on outcome (procedural pain, diagnostic biopsies, inadequate samples, complications, needlesticks to operator, and physician satisfaction) before institution of safety devices (54 patients) and after institution of safety device implementation (56 patients). Safety devices included a patient safety technology-the mechanical aspirating syringe (reciprocating procedure device), and a health care worker safety technology (antineedlestick safety needle). RESULTS: FNA of thyroid could be readily performed with the safety devices. Safety-engineered devices resulted in a 49{\%} reduction in procedural pain scores (P {\textless} 0.0001), a 56{\%} reduction in significant pain (P {\textless} 0.002), a 21{\%} increase in operator satisfaction (P {\textless} 0.0001), and a 5{\%} increase in diagnostic specimens (P = 0.5). No needlesticks to health care workers or patient injuries occurred during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Safety-engineered devices to improve both patient and health care worker safety can be successfully integrated into diagnostic FNA of the thyroid while maintaining outcomes and improving safety.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and fabrication of a 26GHz tone generator for the ISARA Cubesat. The tone generator uses a phase locked loop (PLL) frequency multiplier to get to 26GHz from an on board temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO). The output of the PLL feeds a solid state power amplifier (SSPA) that puts out approximately 27dBm of RF power. The SSPA output then feeds a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) switch which toggles between a high gain and low gain antenna as part of the ISARA experiment. The microwave electronics is packaged in an aluminum chassis and utilizes hybrid assembly technology. There are bare die with ribbon and wire interconnects in addition to printed circuit boards (PCB) which use surface mount technology (SMT) for assembly. Custom distributed circuits were designed for implementing the 26GHz filters, couplers and power detectors. A key aspect of this module's performance is its overall thermal stability which is highly dependent upon its assembly technology. The order of operations of each assembly phase, attachment materials, contamination control and reliability of interconnects all determine how well the hardware performs in flight.},

It is a complete and independent system to be used on board nanosatellites, allowing automated attitude control. To integrate this system into nanosatellites such as Cubesats its size has been reduced down to a cube of side about 5 cm. The result is a low cost attitude control system built with terrestrial components, integrating three micro magnetotorquers, three micro reaction wheels, three magnetometers and redundant control electronics, capable of performing automatics operations on request from the ground. The system can operate as a real time maneuvering system, executing commands sent from the ground or as a standalone attitude control system receiving the solar array status from a hosting satellite and the satellite ephemeris transmitted from the ground station. The main characteristics of the developed system and test results are depicted in this paper.},

abstract = {The paper overviews recent nano-satellite development activities of University of Tokyo, Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory (ISSL). Development of real satellites and actually launching them provides excellent materials for space engineering education as well as project management, which is rather difficult to teach in usual class lectures. In addition, it may lead to a new way of space development with its cheap and quick access to space. Two educational CubeSats were launched successfully in 2003 and 2005, and they have been surviving in space more than 5 years, which showed that the COTS (commercial off the shelf) can be reliably used in space if the system is designed appropriately. Based on the experiences and technologies obtained in CubeSat projects, ISSL initiated practical applications of nano-satellite, starting with PRISM, 8 kg remote sensing satellite aiming for 30 m ground resolution and Nano-JASMINE, 20 kg astrometry satellite, which will be launched in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In order to support these kinds of student-oriented activities in Japan, University Space Engineering Consortium (UNISEC) was founded in 2002 by the author's group, which has had large effect of further facilitating students' space-related activities in Japan. Significance and history of such activities are reviewed briefly, followed by the objectives and future vision of such nano-satellite activities.},

@article{Piattoni2012,
abstract = {This paper describes the design and the manufacturing of a Cubesat platform based on a plastic structure. The Cubesat structure has been realized in plastic material (ABS) using a “rapid prototyping” technique. The “rapid prototyping” technique has several advantages including fast implementation, accuracy in manufacturing small parts and low cost. Moreover, concerning the construction of a small satellite, this technique is very useful thanks to the accuracy achievable in details, which are sometimes difficult and expensive to realize with the use of tools machine. The structure must be able to withstand the launch loads. For this reason, several simulations using an FEM simulation and an intensive vibration test campaign have been performed in the system development and test phase. To demonstrate that this structure is suitable for hosting a complete satellite system, offering innovative integrated solutions, other subsystems have been developed and assembled. Despite its small size, this single unit (1U) Cubesat has a system for active attitude control, a redundant telecommunication system, a payload camera and a photovoltaic system based on high efficiency solar cells. The developed communication subsystem has small dimensions, low power consumption and low cost. An example of the innovations introduced is the antenna system, which has been manufactured inside the ABS structure. The communication protocol which has been implemented, the AX.25 protocol, is mainly used by radio amateurs. The communication system has the capability to transmit both telemetry and data from the payload, in this case a microcamera. The attitude control subsystem is based on an active magnetic system with magnetorquers for detumbling and momentum dumping and three reaction wheels for fine control. It has a total dimension of about 50×50×50 mm. A microcontroller implements the detumbling control law autonomously taking data from integrated magnetometers and executes pointing maneuvers on the basis of commands received in real time from ground. The subsystems developed for this Cubesat have also been designed to be scaled up for larger satellites such as 2U or 3U Cubesats. The additional volume can be used for more complex payloads. Thus the satellite can be used as a low cost platform for companies, institutions or universities to test components in space.},

abstract = {A communications system operating in the 2.4GHz ISM unlicensed band was developed for GeneSat-1, an innovative technology demonstration mission intended to validate the use of research quality instrumentation for in situ biological research and processing. As a key underlying mission-enabling technology, and responding to a low- cost, quick turn-around philosophy, this communications system is based on commercial-of-the-shelf components not originally intended for space flight. The system utilizes a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique widely used in wireless phones, Internet hubs and other devices. This approach provided exceptional benefits relevant to small satellite missions: low cost, highly integrated hardware resulting in small volume, ready commercial availability, plug and play integration, and simple licensing requirements. As a comparison with typical amateur band systems widely used in spacecraft of this class, besides avoiding the restrictions on the nature of the mission, it has the potential for higher throughput and includes security features such as addressing and encryption. Challenges in using this component included the accommodation of Doppler frequency shift, coordinating propagation delays with a time-division multiplexing architecture, and establishing suitable interface requirements for the Earth communication station. GeneSat-1 is a “triple-CubeSat” vehicle launched into LEO in December 2006. Its main mission objectives were successfully achieved during the first few weeks of operation This paper presents a description of the comprehensive analysis and testing produced to attain space qualification and measures of on- orbit performance collected during spacecraft operations, including link availability, effective telemetry throughput and link margin.},

abstract = {The positioning methods based on received signal strength (RSS) measurements, link the RSS values to the position of the mobile station(MS) to be located. Their accuracy depends on the suitability of the propagation models used for the actual propagation conditions. In indoor wireless networks, these propagation conditions are very difficult to predict due to the unwieldy and dynamic nature of the RSS. In this paper, we present a novel method which dynamically estimates the propagation models that best fit the propagation environments, by using only RSS measurements obtained in real time. This method is based on maximizing compatibility of the MS to access points (AP) distance estimates. Once the propagation models are estimated in real time, it is possible to accurately determine the distance between the MS and each AP. By means of these distance estimates, the location of the MS can be obtained by trilateration. The method proposed coupled with simulations and measurements in a real indoor environment, demonstrates its feasibility and suitability, since it outperforms conventional RSS-based indoor location methods without using any radio map information nor a calibration stage.},

abstract = {Millimeter-wave communication achieves multi-Gbps data rates via highly directional beamforming to overcome pathloss and provide the desired SNR. Unfortunately, establishing communication with sufficiently narrow beamwidth to obtain the necessary link budget is a high overhead procedure in which the search space scales with device mobility and the product of the sender-receiver beam resolution. In this paper, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate Blind Beam Steering (BBS) a novel architecture and algorithm that removes in-band overhead for directional mm-Wave link establishment. Our system architecture couples mm-Wave and legacy 2.4/5 GHz bands using out-of-band direction inference to establish (overhead-free) multi-Gbps mm-Wave communication. Further, BBS evaluates direction estimates retrieved from passively overheard 2.4/5 GHz frames to assure highest mm-Wave link quality on unobstructed direct paths. By removing in-band overhead, we leverage mm-Wave's very high throughput capabilities, beam-width scalability and provide robustness to mobility. We demonstrate that BBS achieves 97.8{\%} accuracy estimating direction between pairing nodes using at least 5 detection band antennas. Further, BBS successfully detects unobstructed direct path conditions with an accuracy of 96.5{\%} and reduces the IEEE 802.11ad beamforming training overhead by 81{\%}.},

abstract = {The present design of the new space gamma-ray telescope GAMMA-400 for the energy range 50 MeV–3 TeV is presented. The proposed instrument has an angular resolution of 1–2 degrees at ￼E($\gamma$)∼100MeV and ∼0.01 degrees at ￼E($\gamma$){\textgreater}100GeV and an energy resolution ∼1{\%}∼1{\%} at ￼E($\gamma$){\textgreater}100GeV. By means of a deep segmented calorimeter high energy electron flux can be studied, with a proton rejection factor of about 106. The GAMMA-400 experiment is optimized to address a broad range of science topics, such as search for signatures of dark matter, studies of galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources, galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission, gamma-ray bursts, as well as high-precision measurements of spectra of high energy electrons, protons and nuclei up to the knee.},

abstract = {Recently new and interesting science drivers have emerged for very low frequency radio astronomy from 0.3 MHz to 30 MHz. However Earth bound radio observations at these wavelengths are severely hampered by ionospheric distortions, man made interference, solar flares and even complete reflection below 10 MHz. OLFAR is Orbiting Low Frequency ARray, a project whose aim is to develop a detailed system concept for space based very low frequency large aperture radio interferometric array observing at these very long wavelengths. The OLFAR cluster could either orbit the moon, whilst sampling during the Earth-radio eclipse phase, or orbit the Earth-moon L2 point, sampling almost continuously or Earth-trailing and leading orbit. The aim of this paper is to present the technical requirements for OLFAR and first order estimates of data rates for space based radio astronomy based on the proposed scalable distributed correlator model. The OLFAR cluster will comprise of autonomous flight units, each of which is individually capable of inter satellite communication and down-link. The down-link data rate is heavily dependent on distance of the cluster from Earth and thus the deployment location of OLFAR, which are discussed.},

abstract = {Space-based observations have transformed our understanding of Earth, its environment, the solar system and the universe at large. During past decades, driven by increasingly advanced science questions, space observatories have become more sophisticated and more complex, with costs often growing to billions of dollars. Although these kinds of ever-more-sophisticated missions will continue into the future, small satellites, ranging in mass between 500 kg to 0.1 kg, are gaining momentum as an additional means to address targeted science questions in a rapid, and possibly more affordable, manner. Within the category of small satellites, CubeSats have emerged as a space-platform defined in terms of (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm)- sized cubic units of approximately 1.3 kg each called “U's.” Historically, CubeSats were developed as training projects to expose students to the challenges of real-world engineering practices and system design. Yet, their use has rapidly spread within academia, industry, and government agencies both nationally and internationally. In particular, CubeSats have caught the attention of parts of the U.S. space science community, which sees this platform, despite its inherent constraints, as a way to affordably access space and perform unique measurements of scientific value. The first science results from such CubeSats have only recently become available; however, questions remain regarding the scientific potential and technological promise of CubeSats in the future. Achieving Science with CubeSats reviews the current state of the scientific potential and technological promise of CubeSats. This report focuses on the platform's promise to obtain high- priority science data, as defined in recent decadal surveys in astronomy and astrophysics, Earth science and applications from space, planetary science, and solar and space physics (heliophysics); the science priorities identified in the 2014 NASA Science Plan; and the potential for CubeSats to advance biology and microgravity research. It provides a list of sample science goals for CubeSats, many of which address targeted science, often in coordination with other spacecraft, or use “sacrificial,” or high-risk, orbits that lead to the demise of the satellite after critical data have been collected. Other goals relate to the use of CubeSats as constellations or swarms deploying tens to hundreds of CubeSats that function as one distributed array of measurements.},

abstract = {Realizing inter-satellite links is a must for ensuring the success of cubesat swarm missions. Nevertheless, it has hardly been considered until now. The communication systems for cubesats have to deal with a few peculiar demands regarding consumed power, geometry and throughput. Depending on the type of application, required data rates can go up to tens of megabits per second, while power consumption and physical size are limited by the platform. The proposed communication scheme will combine power-efficient modulation and channel coding with multiple access and spread spectrum techniques, enabling the deployment of multiple satellites. Apart from this, the antenna system has to be designed such that links can be established and maintained independent of the satellites' orientation. An electrically steerable radiation pattern is achieved by placing antennas on each face of the cube. Conformal beamforming provides the system with 5 dBi gain for any desired direction of transmission, eliminating the need for attitude control. Furthermore, using planar antennas reduces the complexity of the mechanical part as they require no deployment.},

@article{Shokri-Ghadikolaei2015,
abstract = {Due to spectrum scarcity in microwave bands used by legacy communication technologies, millimeter wave (mmWave) bands are considered as a promising enabler for 5G cellular networks to provide multi-gigabit wireless access. However, mmWave communications exhibit high attenuations, vulnerability to obstacles, and sparse-scattering environments, which are not taken into account in the existing cellular wireless design approaches. Moreover, the small wavelengths of mmWave signals make it possible to incorporate a large number of antenna elements both at the base stations and at the user equipments, which in turn lead to high directivity gains and fully-directional communications. This level of directionality can result in a network that is noise-limited as opposed to interference-limited. The significant differences between mmWave networks and traditional ones challenge the classical design constraints, objectives, and available degrees of freedom. This demands a reconsideration of almost all design aspects in mmWave systems, where, despite a recent wave of investigations at the physical layer, very little can be found for the MAC layer. This paper aims at filling this important research gap. The purpose of this study is both to survey the state-of-the-art and to discuss the challenges that arise at the MAC layer of mmWave cellular systems and to propose original research directions to address those challenges. Specifically, this paper focuses on the main MAC decisions such as synchronization, random access, handover, channelization, interference management, scheduling, and association. New challenges and new tradeoffs are identified, and solution approaches based on special characteristics of mmWave systems are suggested. It is concluded that fully-directional communication when supported with proper MAC layer design is an essential component of mmWave cellular networks.},

abstract = {CubeSats and small satellites are becoming a way to explore space and to perform science more affordably. As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in terms of physical distance (moving from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) or further), and of the amount of data to relay back to Earth (from Kbits to Mbits), the communication systems currently implemented will not be able to fully support those missions. Two of the possible strategies to solve this issue are the following: 1. Increasing the time available to communicate to the ground by using existing satellite networks as communication relays. 2. Equipping the satellite with a more powerful antenna compatible with the volume and mass constraints imposed by CubeSats and small satellites.},

The primary objective of the SwissCube project is to provide a dynamic and realistic learning environment for undergraduates, graduates and to foster the development of small satellite technologies. Besides the educational objectives, the SwissCube mission objective is to observe the airglow phenomenon (intensity) over selected latitudes and longitudes for a period of 4 months (possibly up to 1 year). The payload consists of a telescope which takes images of the airglow emissions. The telescope has a length of 50 mm. At one end, a CMOS detector captures images with a resolution of 188 × 120 pixels and a pixel size of 24 $\mu$m via a focusing optics. A bandpass filter centered at 767 nm, with a bandwidth of 20 nm, selects the desired wavelength of the airglow. At the other end, a baffle protects the optical system and the detector from straylight. This chapter describes the mission of the satellite and provides information on the Earth observation payload.},

O/OREOS was launched successfully on November 19, 2010, to a high-inclination (72°), 650-km Earth orbit aboard a US Air Force Minotaur IV rocket from Kodiak, Alaska. O/OREOS consists of 3 conjoined cubesat (each 1000 cm3) modules: (i) a control bus; (ii) the Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms (SESLO) experiment; and (iii) the Space Environment Viability of Organics (SEVO) experiment. Among the innovative aspects of the O/OREOS mission are a real-time analysis of the photostability of organics and biomarkers and the collection of data on the survival and metabolic activity for microorganisms at 3 times during the 6-month mission. We report on the spacecraft characteristics, payload capabilities, and present operational phase and flight data from the O/OREOS mission. The science and technology rationale of O/OREOS supports NASA′s scientific exploration program by investigating the local space environment as well as space biology relevant to Moon and Mars missions. It also serves as a precursor for experiments on small satellites, the International Space Station (ISS), future free-flyers and lunar surface exposure facilities.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need for Earth Observation (EO) missions to meet the information requirements in connection with Global Change Studies. Small and cost-effective missions are powerful tools to flexibly react to information requirements with space-borne solutions. Small satellite missions can be conducted relatively quickly and inexpensively by using commercial off-the-shelf-technologies, or they can be enhanced by using advanced technologies. A new class of advanced small satellites, including autonomously operating “intelligent” satellites may be created, opening new fields of application. The increasing number of small satellites and their applications drive developments in the fields of small launchers, small ground station networks, cost-effective data distribution methods, and cost-effective management and quality assurance procedures. There are many advantages of small satellite missions, like more frequent mission opportunities, a faster return of data, larger variety of missions, more rapid expansion of the technical and/or scientific knowledge base, greater involvement of small industry, feasibility by universities and others. This paper deals with general trends in the field of small satellite missions for Earth observation. Special attention is given to the potential of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of small satellite based systems. Examples show small satellites offer also the unique possibility to install affordable constellations to provide good daily coverage of the globe and/or allow us to observe dynamic phenomena. The facts and examples given in this paper lead to the conclusion: Small satellites are already powerful tools for monitoring global, regional and local phenomena. In the future, their application spectrum will even broaden based on the ongoing development in many areas of technology and observation techniques.},

abstract = {In this paper we review key properties of proposed high performance protocols for random access (RA) satellite channels for both time division and code division multiple access (TDMA/CDMA) techniques. The proposed protocols by far outperform traditional satellite random access techniques without the need for quick feedback from the gateway. This makes possible to avoid the utilization of demand assigned capacity for the transmission of small/medium size bursts of packets. A fair comparative performance of state-of-the-art TDMA and CDMA RA schemes is provided together with a summary of their key performance results. It is shown that the proposed enhanced RA protocols, although different between TDMA and CDMA, share commonalities as they exploit iterative interference cancellation at the demodulator side and demonstrate to provide even better performance in the presence of received carrier power unbalance. Typical application scenarios of these enhanced random access protocols are then illustrated, as well as possible ways to combine random access and demand assigned protocols.},

abstract = {This master's thesis presents a study on a slot and microstrip patch as the two main types of antennas for the use on Cube Satellite (CubeSat). A study on the fundamentals of the slot antenna is researched and a circularly polarized (CPd) cavity-backed cross slot antenna and its two-element array for the CubeSat are designed and fabricated. Fabricated two-element phased array cross slot antenna has higher radiation gain and steered radiation pattern compared to the fabricated single cross slot antenna. A CPd square microstrip patch antenna for the application of the CubeSat is designed and compared with a commercial CPd microstrip patch antenna. It is concluded that our designed microstrip patch antenna has a better performance compared to the commercial one. The last part of the research focuses on the design of miniaturized slot antennas for the CubeSat working at an ultra high frequency (UHF) band. The di erent techniques and challenges that we face through the miniaturization are articulated throughout the research and expanded upon in this thesis. The antenna simulations were performed using Ansoft High Frequency System Simula- tor (HFSS) and the nal designs for the CPd cavity-backed single and two-element cross slot antennas and CPd microstrip patch antenna were fabricated using a circuit board millingiv machine. These were then measured inside an anechoic chamber for the radiation pattern. Both antennas had high radiation gain and good CPd radiation quality.},

abstract = {The rise of machine-to-machine communications has rekindled interest in random access protocols as a support for a massive number of uncoordinatedly transmitting devices. The legacy ALOHA approach is developed under a collision model, where slots containing collided packets are considered as waste. However, if the common receiver (e.g. base station) is able to store the collision slots and use them in a transmission recovery process based on successive interference cancellation, the design space for access protocols is radically expanded. We present the paradigm of coded random access, in which the structure of the access protocol can be mapped to a structure of an erasure-correcting code defined on a graph. This opens the possibility to use coding theory and tools for designing efficient random access protocols, offering markedly better performance than ALOHA. Several instances of coded random access protocols are described, as well as a case study on how to upgrade a legacy ALOHA system using the ideas of coded random access.},

Most of the capture models described in the literature are based on the signal-to-interference power ratios, with the assumption that the captured packet is error-free. In the paper, a capture model is proposed for slotted ALOHA systems employing symbol erasures and error-and-erasure correcting codes. In contrast to previous models, the model uses a target bit error rate as the capture measure, which in turn is controlled by a symbol-erasure threshold. Performance of the proposed model is analysed taking into account modulation and coding techniques, the signal-to-noise ratio, the user spatial distribution as well as Rayleigh channel fading},

abstract = {In this paper we treat the problem of identification of a subset of active users in a set of a large number of potentially active users. The users from the subset are activated randomly, such that the access point (AP) does not know the subset or its size a priori. The active users are contending to report their activity to the AP over a multiple access channel. We devise a contention algorithm that assumes a combination of physical-layer network coding and K-out-of-N signature coding, allowing for multiple detection of up to K users at the access point. In addition, we rely on the principles of coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) and use of successive interference cancellation to enable subsequent resolution of the collisions that originally featured more than K users. The objective is to identify the subset of active users such that the target performance, e.g., probability of active user resolution and/or throughput is reached, which implies that the duration of the contention period is also not known a priori. In contrast to standard CSA approaches, in the proposed algorithm each user, active or not, has a predefined schedule of slots in which it sends its signature. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm both in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We also derive an estimator that, based on the observation of collision multiplicities, estimates how many users are active and thereby enables tuning of the length of the contention period.},

abstract = {Nowadays CubeSat class picosatellites offer support for serious scientific experiments onboard, but in the past, they were mainly used by universities for student training programs. Almost all of these small picosatellites have problem with low power due to small solar cells surface and small solar cell efficiency. Furthermore, the amount of energy from solar cells is smaller in orbit environments than expected from simplified calculations, so many CubeSats have power malfunctions. It could be due to underestimated several solar cells parameters dependencies. For more accurate calculations of picosatellite accessible power, it is necessary to known some important solar cells behaviors, which are unpublished. For example, efficiency dependence on the cells temperature and efficiency dependence on the sunlight incidence angle is not negligible. This paper is focused on discovering these dependencies and on improved calculations of the accessible solar power of Spectrolab triangular advanced solar cells. These cells (TASC) are based on triple junction gallium arsenide materials with germanium substrate and will be used for PilsenCUBE picosatellite.},

abstract = {The ALOHA protocol allows many uncoordinated terminals to transmit data packets through a common channel. The application of ALOHA to short range (indoor or mobile) radio systems containing mobile terminals that send packets to a central base station is studied. In such systems, terminal-to-base distances can be vastly different and there can be pronounced shadowing. This gives rise to a capture effect at the receiver, where the packet arriving with the highest energy has a good chance of being detected accurately, even when other packets are present. It is well known that this capture effect improves the throughput and delay characteristics of the system as a whole. One of the principal findings is that even the user with the weakest signal shares in these improvements. This result is derived for the realistic case in which each terminal has a buffer to store packets that arrive while the terminal is waiting to transmit packets that were destroyed in earlier collisions.},

The transmission environment in this service is demanding - excess propagation loss and heavy multipath, due to obstructions which are abundant in the urban environment, vary and fluctuate in time as the mobile user is in motion. Cellular telecommunication systems' architecture and signal design are designed to counter the impairments of the transmission by the channel. Simple statistical characterization of the channel, based on sample measurements or on otherwise generic statistical assumptions, is far from providing the spatial-time channel variations as required for description and analysis of its interaction with the communications system. An arsenal of physically-based canonical propagation models serve as a solid basis for an insight into the interaction process, while the statistical coating covers for the unknown exact behavior.},

Using a Hoberman{\&}{\#}x00A1;{\&}{\#}x00A6;s planar foldable linkage, in which rotation in the {\&}{\#}x00D6;- direction provides translation in the radial direction, a radiating shape-shifting surface (RSSS) can be developed. To demonstrate the interesting characteristics of the approach, two resonant frequency-tunable antennas were prototyped. The antennas incorporate parasitic patches, which are repositioned over a fixed circular microstrip patch antenna. The mechanical movement results in tunability of the antenna resonant frequency without degrading the return loss bandwidth or radiation pattern. Experimental results for a design with electromagneticallycoupled parasitic patches demonstrate tuning of the resonant frequency by {\textgreater}10{\%} over the 2.7-3 GHz frequency range with essentially constant gain and return loss bandwidth. Greater than 26{\%} tuning bandwidth is achieved with the second design in which the parasitic patches make electrical contact with the primary antenna element.},

@article{Keller1962,
abstract = {The geometrical theory of diffraction is an extension of geometrical optics which accounts for diffraction. It introduces diffracted rays in addition to the usual rays of geometrical optics. These rays are produced by incident rays which hit edges, corners, or vertices of boundary surfaces, or which graze such surfaces. Various laws of diffraction, analogous to the laws of reflection and refraction, are employed to characterize the diffracted rays. A modified form of Fermats principle, equivalent to these laws, can also be used. Diffracted wave fronts are defined, which can be found by a Huygens wavelet construction. There is an associated phase or eikonal function which satisfies the eikonal equation. In addition complex or imaginary rays are introduced. A field is associated with each ray and the total field at a point is the sum of the fields on all rays through the point. The phase of the field on a ray is proportional to the optical length of the ray from some reference point. The amplitude varies in accordance with the principle of conservation of energy in a narrow tube of rays. The initial value of the field on a diffracted ray is determined from the incident field with the aid of an appropriate diffraction coefficient. These diffraction coefficients are determined from certain canonical problems. They all vanish as the wavelength tends to zero. The theory is applied to diffraction by an aperture in a thin screen diffraction by a disk, etc., to illustrate it. Agreement is shown between the predictions of the theory and various other theoretical analyses of some of these problems. Experimental confirmation of the theory is also presented. The mathematical justification of the theory on the basis of electromagnetic theory is described. Finally, the applicability of this theory, or a modification of it, to other branches of physics is explained.},

abstract = {Digital terrain models (DTM) are a very important tool for all sorts of glacier studies and serve as a basis for many applications. The latest development is the combination of DTM with digital image-processing techniques which enable a much better visualization of the DTM, and thus a better interpretation of glaciological phenomena.These new technologies have been applied in an investigation of the Vaughan Lewis Icefall, Juneau Icefield, Alaska. A DTM has been produced by means of photogrammetric measurements, and a glacier-flow velocity of up to 5.70 m d−1 in the steepest part has been derived. The possibilities for the interpretation of the glacier topography have been significantly improved by using digital image-processing algorithms for the visualization of the DTM.},

abstract = {Recently, contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) has been introduced as a simple but effective improvement to slotted ALOHA. It relies on MAC burst repetitions and on interference cancellation to increase the normalized throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. CRDSA allows achieving a larger throughput than slotted ALOHA, at the price of an increased average transmitted power. A way to trade-off the increment of the average transmitted power and the improvement of the throughput is presented in this paper. Specifically, it is proposed to divide each MAC burst in k sub-bursts, and to encode them via a (n, k) erasure correcting code. The n encoded sub-bursts are transmitted over the MAC channel, according to specific time/frequency-hopping patterns. Whenever n {\&}{\#}x2212; e {\&}{\#}x2265; k sub-bursts (of the same burst) are received without collisions, erasure decoding allows recovering the remaining e sub-bursts (which were lost due to collisions). An interference cancellation process can then take place, removing in e slots the interference caused by the e recovered sub-bursts, possibly allowing the correct decoding of sub-bursts related to other bursts. The process is thus iterated as for the CRDSA case.},

This project is carried out by a cooperation between the Departments of Physics and Industrial Engineering and Information Technology of the University of Trieste with the involvement of the Istituto Nazionale di AstroFisica and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare. A few local companies are participating in the project allowing a direct contact between research and industrial field. The main goal is to measure the Earth magnetic field and map the radiation flux. Orbital parameters from a GPS are used to estimate the atmospheric density. An agile mission as AtmoCube can be considered as a precursor of a series of small scientific missions for the analysis of the Earth atmosphere at very low costs and can play a pioneering role in the low-cost probes of the Sun- Atmosphere-Earth system. The project has a strong educational interest: students improve their scientific and technical knowledge by personally designing the satellite sub-systems. The status of the first AtmoCube satellite is described here with special attention to the lesson learned during the four years of AtmoCube development and possible future AtmoCube-2 missions.},

abstract = {A Cubesat mission with a deployable solar sail of 5 meter by 5 meter in a sun-synchronous low earth orbit is analyzed to demonstrate solar sailing using active attitude stabilization of the sail panel. The sail panel is kept parallel to the orbital plane to minimize aerodynamic drag and optimize the orbit inclination change caused by the solar pressure force normal to the sail surface. A practical control system is proposed, using a combination of small 2-dimensional translation of the sail panel and 3-axis magnetic torquing which is proved to have sufficient control authority over the gravity gradient and aerodynamic disturbance torques. Minituarized CMOS cameras are used as sun and nadir vector attitude sensors and a robust Kalman filter is used to accurately estimate the inertially referenced body rates from only the sun vector measurements. It is shown through realistic simulation tests that the proposed control system, although inactive during eclipse, will be able to stabilize the sail panel to within ±2° in all attitude angles during the sunlit part of the orbit, when solar sailing is possible.},

abstract = {Bipartite graphs have been often used to describe the structure of iteratively-decodable error correcting codes, and to analyze their iterative decoding performance. This paper deals with the application of bipartite graphs to a different problem. More specifically, the bipartite graph description is applied to the iterative interference cancelation process of a recently introduced random access scheme named contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA. Contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancelation to increase the throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. The graph representation permits to establish a bridge between the iterative interference cancelation process and the iterative erasure recovery process of graph-based codes. Assuming ideal interference cancelation, it is shown how the use of irregular bipartite graphs allows achieving a throughput close to 0.97 packets/slot with a maximum burst repetition rate equal to 16. The iterative interference cancelation analysis is further extended to the case of non-ideal interference cancelation. A discussion on the normalized efficiency is provided as well, considering the average power used by the different approaches.},

The codes are built from highly irregular bipartite graphs with carefully chosen degree patterns on both sides. Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds},

abstract = {This paper addresses the following question: how reliable is it to use the unbounded path-loss model G(d) = d-alpha, where alpha is the path-loss exponent, to model the decay of transmitted signal power in wireless networks? G(d) is a good approximation for the path-loss in wireless communications for large values of d but is not valid for small values of d due to the singularity at 0. This model is often used along with a random uniform node distribution, even though in a group of uniformly distributed nodes some may be arbitrarily close to one another. The unbounded path-loss model is compared to a more realistic bounded path-loss model, and it is shown that the effect of the singularity on the total network interference level is significant and cannot be disregarded when nodes are uniformly distributed. A phase transition phenomenon occurring in the interference behavior is analyzed in detail. Several performance metrics are also examined by using the computed interference distributions. In particular, the effects of the singularity at 0 on bit error rate, packet success probability and wireless channel capacity are analyzed.},

To improve mission capability, the current dipole configurations, that offer gains of approximately 5 dB, needed significant improvement. This paper presents a high-gain solution by incorporating a 6-element linear Yagi-Uda antenna into a deployable solar array prototype. Measured array gain was 11.5 dBi with a 53 MHz bandwidth, E- and H-plane half-power beamwidths of 46 and 58 degrees respectively, and an S11 of −19 dB at 435 MHz.},

abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) area networks connect a gateway with a huge number of energy-constrained end-devices. Therefore, energy efficiency is essential to prolong the lifetime of M2M networks. In this paper, we consider an M2M area network composed of hundreds or thousands of end-devices that periodically transmit data upon request from a gateway. We propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol based on Frame Slotted-ALOHA (FSA) with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), also referred to as SIC-FSA, for data collection applications. By means of comprehensive computer-based simulations, we evaluate the delay and the energy consumed by the gateway and the enddevices using SIC-FSA. We have compared the delay and energy performance provided by SIC-FSA with that of conventional FSA and diversity-FSA (D-FSA). Results show that SIC-FSA can reduce the delay and energy consumption of the gateway in more than 50{\%}, and the energy consumed by an end-device in more than 10{\%}, with respect to FSA in dense M2M networks equipped with radio-transceivers in compliance with the IEEE 802.11 physical layer.},

The scheme combines diversity transmission of data bursts with efficient interference cancellation techniques. It is shown that CRDSA largely outperforms the classical lotted ALOHA (SA) technique in terms of throughput under equal packet loss ratio conditions (e.g. 17-fold improvement at packet loss ratio = 2 middot 10-2). CRDSA allows to boost the performance of random access (RA) channels in the return link of interactive satellite networks, making RA very efficient and providing low latency for the transmission of small size sparse packets. Implementation-wise it is shown that the CRDSA technique can be easily integrated in systems equipped with digital burst demodulators.},

It is developed with double application of the sequential rotation feeding technique. The array employs corner-truncated microstrip patches as the basic element, and then a four-element array as the subarray. By applying the sequential rotation technique twice to design the feed networks, a full 64-element array with good performance is obtained. A prototype of the full array was constructed and tested. The measurement results show that both the reflection coefficient of less than 10 dB and axial ratio of less than 3 dB have been achieved over a frequency band of 27-31 GHz; this corresponds to a wide bandwidth of 13.8{\%}. Due to its planar configuration, the proposed array can find good applications in aerospace, radar, and communication systems.},

The proposed scheme assumes that each user independently accesses the wireless link in each slot with a predefined probability, resulting in a distribution of user transmissions over slots. The operation bears analogy with rateless codes, both in terms of probability distributions as well as to the fact that the ALOHA frame becomes fluid and adapted to the current contention process. Our aim is to optimize the slot access probability in order to achieve rateless-like distributions, focusing both on the maximization of the resolution probability of user transmissions and the throughput of the scheme.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, more than one hundred CubeSats have been launched, and this number will double very soon. However, the increasing number of launched satellites is not yet followed by an improvement in the communication technology they use: to date, the majority of orbiting CubeSats transmits their data using frequencies allocated in the radio amateur service. If this trend does not change in favor of more advanced technologies, this class of satellites will not be considered a viable solution for commercial purposes, and thus relegated to the role of educational tool or technology demonstrator. The transition to higher frequencies, like those in the Ka band, will enable the design of small and directive antennas, and will make faster data rates attainable. In the nanosatellites development, an antenna can be very demanding in terms of mass and real estate; efficient radiators such as horn antennas or parabolic reflectors in most cases are not viable solutions because of their mass and surface requirements. An ideal antenna should be thin, flat, small, light and designed to be mounted on the outer surface of the spacecraft. In this context, a microstrip array antenna is a convenient solution in terms of size, mass, mounting and cost. In this paper we design a circularly polarized antenna array, with uniform polarization over a wider bandwidth with respect to the bandwidth of the basic array element. In the design of the proposed array, many parameters are subject to optimization: specifically, gain and bandwidth shall be maximized, while the axial ratio and insertion losses shall be minimized. These parameters can be optimized at every stage of the design: for the single patch, the subarray, and the final array. In order to identify the best compromise possible between physical parameters and electromagnetic performances, a multi-objective optimization approach will be adopted. Finally, also the excitations of the elements are optimized following a deterministic algorithm which allows to improve the electromagnetic performances of the uniform array. Numerical results of the consecutive optimization steps will be illustrated.},

abstract = {Contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) is a simple but effective improvement of slotted ALOHA. CRDSA relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancellation (IC), achieving a peak throughput T ≅ 0.55, whereas for slotted ALOHA T ≅ 0.37. In this paper we show that the IC process of CRDSA can be conveniently described by a bipartite graph, establishing a bridge between the IC process and the iterative erasure decoding of graph-based codes. Exploiting this analogy, we show how a high throughput can be achieved by selecting variable burst repetition rates according to given probability distributions, leading to irregular graphs. A framework for the probability distribution optimization is provided. Based on that, we propose a novel scheme, named irregular repetition slotted ALOHA, that can achieve a throughput T ≅ 0.97 for large frames and near to T ≅ 0.8 in practical implementations, resulting in a gain of {\~{}} 45{\%} w.r.t. CRDSA. An analysis of the normalized efficiency is introduced, allowing performance comparisons under the constraint of equal average transmission power. Simulation results, including an IC mechanism described in the paper, substantiate the validity of the analysis and confirm the high efficiency of the proposed approach down to a signal-to-noise ratio as a low as Eb/N0=2 dB.},

abstract = {In this paper a method for estimating the relative orbit is proposed. The method requires a minimum number of simple sensors. The design of observers for formation-flying control, which is formulated as a control problem of tracking the target satellite, is treated. If the equations of the relative motion of the target and the chaser satellites are rewritten in the Local Vertical/Local Horizontal (LVLH) coordinate system, a nonlinear control system of the sixth order is obtained. It is very well known that such a control problem can be solved by a (linear or nonlinear) state controller. The formation-flying models are reviewed and analysed with respect to their observability according to the measured quantities. Based on the results of the observability analysis two state observers enabling an estimation of all the states are proposed in the paper: a simple observer of the linearised system and a nonlinear observer. Since cheap, small satellites are targeted, the application of cheap sensors is studied. In addition, the possibility of measuring the three relative position coordinates of the chaser satellite with a camera and a compass is given with some simulation results demonstrating the suppression of the measurement noise, which is significant when using cheap, COTS sensors and cameras.},

In contrast to previous models, the model uses a target bit error rate as the capture measure, which in turn is controlled by a symbol-erasure threshold. Performance of the proposed model is analysed taking into account modulation and coding techniques, the signal-to-noise ratio, the user spatial distribution as well as Rayleigh channel fading},

Nevertheless, this thruster can be also utilized to perform formation flying, small orbit changes and Cubesat end of life deorbiting. A test campaign has been carried out to prove that the thruster and the conditioning electronics lifetimes are long enough to utilize all the propellant stored on-board. From the results of the test, the PPTCUP-EM can deliver a total impulse of 42.9±3.9 N s in about 1,125,000 shots. Moreover during the test campaign, a total of more than 1,800,000 shots have been achieved providing a safety factor of about 60{\%} with respect to the number of required shots. The results gathered, including a preliminary characterization of the electromagnetic noise generated by the unit, are presented and show that the overall thruster performance is not influenced by the thruster aging.},

Some of the whiskers are long enough to become shorts between the neighboring legs of the leadframe. How to suppress their growth and how to perform accelerated test of Sn whisker growth are crucial reliability issues in the electronic packaging industry. In this paper, we report the study of spontaneous Sn whisker growth at room temperature on eutectic SnCu and pure Sn finishes. Both compressive stress and surface oxide on Sn are necessary conditions for whisker growth. Structure and stress analyses by using micro-diffraction in synchrotron radiation are reported.

unshadowed line-of-sight propagation over a land-mobile satellite link.
Equipment aboard a van recorded a CW signal from INMARSAT's

Nevada, Washington, and Oregon. Elevation angles ranged from 7° to
14°. The van carried a tracking helix antenna with beamwidths in the
principal planes of approximately ±18°. Multipath fading was
observed in flat and hilly terrain and is compared with an example of
fading due to tree shadowing. The measurements demonstrate that
multipath effects at low elevation angles may result in fades exceeding
7 dB for approximately 1{\%} of the driving distance for a worst case
scenario corresponding to driving in rolling, hilly terrain where the
satellite is in front or behind of the vehicle. Fading in such a case is
typically dominated by a single multipath reflection from a terrain
feature. On the other hand, tree shadowing at low elevation (7°) may
result in fades which exceed 25 dB at the 1{\%} level},

Rice showed that if the envelope of the reflected wave on a loaded transmission line were to equal or exceed the maximum value in the closed interval, then `singing' or oscillation could be expected to occur and the analog transmission system would become unstable and useless for the transmission of information.

The compressive force is self-generated and the sample responses by growing stress-free whiskers. While a whisker grows out of a surface, it requires an oxidized surface and the oxide has to be protective. An oxide-free metal under compression in ultra-high vacuum will not grow whiskers. Due to a very limited temperature range, from room temperature to 60 °C, of spontaneous growth of Sn whiskers, a systematic study of the growth is difficult because if the temperature is lower, there is insufficient atomic diffusion and if the temperature is higher, there is no driving force because of stress relief. In this paper we review briefly the creep behavior of whisker growth on beta-Sn surfaces. We present a model of grain boundary fluid flow mechanism of growth of Sn whiskers.

abstract = {Completely general formulas are given for computing at any point above a plane earth of finite conductivity the vector electric field for a source which may be a combination of vertical and horizontal electric dipoles or a loop antenna with its axis parallel or perpendicular to the earth. As illustrations of the above general methods, formulas are derived for the ground-wave radiation from (1) a grounded vertical antenna carrying a sinusoidal current distribution and (2) elevated vertical and horizontal half-wave antennas. The "effective height" of the grounded vertical antenna is determined as a function of the ground constants, and this formula is then used to determine the effect of the ground constants on the groundwave field intensity in the neighborhood of a quarter-wave antenna. The formulas are also used to show the influence of antenna height on the attenuation of high and ultra-high frequencies. The forward tilt, i.e., Er/Ez, which occurs for the electric vector lying in the vertical plane passing through the antenna, is also easily computed from the formulas given and is shown graphically. An expression for the Poynting vector is derived, and it is shown that a part of the energy in the wave near the ground flows downward into the ground.},

abstract = {We propose an uncoordinated medium access control (MAC) protocol, called all-to-all broadcast coded slotted ALOHA (B-CSA) for reliable all-to-all broadcast in vehicular networks. Unlike unicast coded slotted ALOHA, in B-CSA each user acts as both transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex mode. The half-duplex mode gives rise to a double unequal error protection (DUEP) phenomenon: the more the user repeats its packet, the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other users, but the lower the probability for this user to decode packets from others. We analyze the performance of B-CSA over the packet erasure channel for a finite frame length. In particular, we provide a general analysis of stopping sets for B-CSA and derive an analytical approximation of the performance in the error floor (EF) region, which captures the DUEP feature of B-CSA. Simulation results reveal that the proposed approximation predicts very well the performance of B-CSA in the EF region. Finally, we compare the proposed B-CSA protocol with carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), the current MAC mechanism in vehicular networks. The results show that B-CSA is able to support a much lager number of users than CSMA with the same reliability.},

Proposed here is a programme to create a much greater understanding in this area through the deployment of a dedicated space asset along with coordinated ground stations, modelling and the creation of a highly accessible database. The space element would comprise two co-orbiting spacecraft (TwinSat) involving a microsatellite and a nanosatellite, each including a suite of science instruments appropriate to this study. Over a mission duration of 3 years ∼ 400 earthquakes in the range 6-6.9 on the Richter scale would be ‘observed'. Such a programme is a prerequisite for an effective earthquake early warning system.},

Two concepts of energy transfer, i.e. Direct Energy Transfer and Peak Power Tracker, are reviewed and compared in details. For each concept different methods of main bus voltage regulation, like unregulated bus, regulated bus, semi-regulated bus, quasi-regulated bus and hybrid bus are discussed. They have been evaluated by comparing their advantages, disadvantages, and their applications in different space missions.

Proposed methodology approach, author will arrange, classify and categorize image into database in order to solve identified problem of retrieval and semantic gap. This proposal in progress is to solve this underlying problem of semantic gap for large images databases for small satellite database (such as CubeSats constellation) and look as well effective efficiency algorithm to improve existing methods. This paper proposes a solution based on image classification and recognition methods (such k-nearest classification and support vector machine methods) to solve this underlying semantic gap problem.},

abstract = {Random access is well motivated and has been widely applied when the network trafﬁc is bursty and the expected throughput is not high. The main reason behind relatively low-throughput expectations is that collided packets are typically discarded. In this paper, we develop a novel protocol exploiting successive interference cancellation (SIC) in a tree algorithm (TA), where collided packets are reserved for reuse. Our SICTA protocol can achieve markedly higher maximum stable throughput relative to existing alternatives. Throughput performance is analyzed for general d-ary SICTA with both gated and window access. It is shown that the throughput for d-ary SICTA with gated access is about (ln d)=(d 1), and can reach 0:693 for d = 2. This represents a 40{\%} increase over the renowned ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve (FCFS) 0:487 tree algorithm. Delay performance is also analyzed for SICTA with gated access, and numerical results are provided.},

In contrast to relatively larger satellites, CubeSats are often launched with minimal shielding structures. Therefore, detailed modeling of a CubeSat is performed based on currently available standard platforms. The geometrical modeling is then used for an estimation of the ionizing doses for various locations within the CubeSat spacecraft operating at low altitudes. The calculation is reiterated and extended for more exotic orbits, such as geostationary Earth orbits and lunar orbits, for the potential application of CubeSats in challenging space missions.},

Currently there are hundreds of active space programs around the world that communicate in outer space. However, the concept of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage. Considerable amount of common standards and research is required before widespread deployment occurs to make IPN feasible. This paper presents a concise picture of the current space networking technologies and architectures. It discusses the Interplanetary Internet and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) concepts along with the various space networks that are currently deployed. The paper also identifies the significant areas of space network design and operation that still require extensive research and development.},

abstract = {In the near future, there is potential for a tremendous expan- sion in the number of Earth-orbiting CubeSats, due to re- duced cost associated with platform standardization, avail- ability of standardized parts for CubeSats, and reduced launch- ing costs due to improved packaging methods and lower cost launchers. However, software algorithms capable of ef- ficiently coordinating CubeSats have not kept up with their hardware gains, making it likely that these CubSats will be severely underutilized. Fortunately, these coordination is- sues can be addressed with multiagent algorithms. In this paper, we show how a multiagent system can be used to ad- dress the particular problem of how a third party should bid for use of existing Earth-observing CubeSats so that it can achieve optical coverage over a key geographic region of in- terest. In this model, an agent is assigned to every CubeSat from which observations may be purchased, and agents must decide how much to offer for these services. We address this problem by having agents use reinforcement learning algo- rithms with agent-specific shaped rewards. The results show an eight fold improvement over a simple strawman alloca- tion algorithmand a two fold improvement over amultiagent system using standard reward functions.},

abstract = {Picosatellites, restricted in power, mass and volume, provide incredible educational opportunities and challenges for engineering students. With the completion of Cal Poly's first satellite, CP1, Cal Poly's Picosatellite Project (PolySat) started its second satellite, CP2. The CP2 team wanted to develop a generic bus capable of supporting a wide variety of payloads. To this end, CP2 required significant improvement from the CP1 design. A key area for improvement was the communication system. Designed and built by undergraduate engineering students at Cal Poly, the communication system for the Cal Poly Bus (CPB) is highly integrated and efficient. The fully redundant digital communication system and the Telemetry, Telecommand, and Control (TT{\&}C) system have been incorporated into a single printed circuit board, increasing the flexibility of the bus. This thesis outlines the objectives and requirements of the CPB's communication and TT{\&}C systems and describes how those requirements are met in the design. It also discusses lessons learned and applied from CP1, the development methods employed, and modifications for in-orbit operations. Additionally, this thesis explores potential weaknesses in the design and presents test results to provide a characterization of the system.},

The main objective for this present project work is to realize a design oriented analysis over a real challenge. A student satellite is to be launched in space and the power supply subsystem must be realized. In order to accomplish the task, few topologies of the power supply will be analyzed. The best solution is chosen, efficiency of the system being one of the most important criteria. For practical implementation, components are selected taking into account space reserved for the board inside the satellite and the operating temperature range. Thermal analysis of the power subsystem is performed and basis for a more extended analysis for the whole satellite are stated. Housekeeping data must be acquired for the solar cells, batteries and different users. Partial measurements performed are showing that the system designed can work in concordance with the requirements and future improvements will be added, if they are necessary. Page},

The design procedure is based on analyzing the CubeSat standard and defining the physical and geometrical constraints, both for a general Cubesat and the particular case of e-st@r, multiple possible configurations are analyzed and compared to define the most suitable one. The use of Components Off-The-Shelf (COTS) materials is considered for the manufacturing of all parts of the system and utilized if acceptable. The lock system can be seen as one of the critical points of the system because it has to ensure that the antenna will not open during launch, but also that it opens when in orbit, so an optimization of already existing lock systems is pursued. We considered a two fault tolerant system to have an acceptable level of confidence. Briefly the manufacturing of all parts and the tests campaign of the assembled system is then proposed with some conclusive considerations on the environmental impact of the system.},

This new system aims to minimize communications link losses caused by unpredictable variations of the radiation pattern of the antenna in spacecraft that spin freely. It is based on the combination of multiple signals orthogonally polarized. The Ground Station that controls the XaTcobeo spacecraft has implemented this system. The spacecraft has been launched recently and is still in LEOP (Launch and Early Orbit Phase).},

abstract = {A method is presented for generating circularly polarized radiation from an array composed of linearly polarized elements having unique angular and phase arrangements. With this technique the complexity, weight, and RF loss of the array feed can be significantly reduced, especially in a large array. This uniquely formed array has the capability of generating excellent circular polarization (CP) over a relatively wide frequency bandwidth. In addition, the array is capable of scanning its main beam in the principal planes to relatively wide angles from its broadside direction without serious degradation to its CP quality. Another feature of this uniquely arranged array is a reduction in the occurrence of mutual coupling. The discussion in this paper places special emphasis on the microstrip type of radiator, although the technique presented can be adapted to most types of linearly polarized antenna elements.},

abstract = {We introduce a framework to study slotted Aloha with cooperative base stations. Assuming a geographic-proximity communication model, we propose several decoding algorithms with different degrees of base stations' cooperation (noncooperative, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal). With spatial cooperation, neighboring base stations inform each other whenever they collect a user within their coverage overlap; temporal cooperation corresponds to (temporal) successive interference cancellation done locally at each station. We analyze the four decoding algorithms and establish several fundamental results. With all algorithms, the peak throughput (average number of decoded users per slot, across all base stations) increases linearly with the number of base stations. Further, temporal and spatio-temporal cooperations exhibit a threshold behavior with respect to the normalized load (number of users per station, per slot). There exists a positive load G*, such that, below G*, the decoding probability is asymptotically maximal possible, equal the probability that a user is heard by at least one base station; with non-cooperative decoding and spatial cooperation, we show that G* is zero. Finally, with spatio-temporal cooperation, we optimize the degree distribution according to which users transmit their packet replicas; the optimum is in general very different from the corresponding optimal distribution of the single-base station system.},

abstract = {Hands-on education is recognized as an invaluable tool to improve students' skills, to stimulate their enthusiasm and to educate them to teamwork. University class satellite programs should be developed keeping in mind that education is the main goal and that university satellites are a unique opportunity to make involved students familiar with all the phases of space missions. Moreover university budgets for education programs are much lower than for industrial satellites programs. Therefore two main constraints must be respected: a time schedule fitting with the student course duration and a low economic budget. These have an impact on the standard which can be followed in university class satellite programs. In this paper university-class satellite standardization is discussed on the basis of UNISAT program experience, reporting successful project achievements and lessons learned through unsuccessful experiences. The UNISAT program was established at the Scuola di Ingegneria Aerospaziale by the Group of Astrodynamics of the University of Rome “La Sapienza” (GAUSS) as a research and education program in which Ph.D. and graduate students have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience on small space missions. Four university satellites (UNISAT, UNISAT-2, UNISAT-3, UNISAT-4), weighing about 10 kg, have been designed, manufactured, tested and launched every two years since 2000 in the framework of this program In the paper, after a brief overview of new GAUSS programs, an analysis of the UNISAT satellites ground test campaign is carried out, identifying the most critical procedures and requirements to be fulfilled. Moreover a device for low earth orbit low-cost satellite end-of-life disposal is presented; this system (SIRDARIA) complies with the international guidelines on space debris.},

Since much of the operating environment is not not known in advance, cognitive informatics and computing should play a critical role in the design and operation. This paper describes such a system, the T-Sat1 nanosatellite. The satellite is being developed by undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Manitoba, as an extension of the standard classroom experience. Particular attention is given to the formation and maintenance of a team of teams, including the teams focusing on the satellite subsystems, assembly, integration and testing, as well as the teams of advisors from academia, aerospace industry, other industries, business, military, government, and other organizations such as the radio community.

abstract = {In the frame of the ESA project MAST, requiring the design of a typical antenna system for small platform, we developed a specific design strategy, based on the use of platform- independent antennas, which led to the implementation of the simulation software SatAF. Targeting the accurate predictions of the radiation performance of large arrays of identical elements, together with a competitive computational time, the simple 3D Array Theory was integrated in SatAF with original implementations of the Method of Moments. In view of dedicated applications to slot antennas, a novel, simplified slot excitation model was developed, allowing the realistic representation of the physical feedingmechanism without the necessity of including the feeding structure in the simulation model. The “Magic Distance Inspired” method, an original formulation of the Nystr¨ om method for the numerical approximation of Integral Equations, allowed the replacement of the time- demanding computation of the four fold integrals, necessary in canonical MoM algorithms, with point-to-point computations performed according to special point grids. Together with a significative reduction of computational time, the formulation offers a number of advantages, like an efficient computation of the singular, quasi- and non-singular entries of the MoM ma- trix with a single formulation, and the possibility of extension to complex environment where, for instance, potentials and MPIE encounter difficulties. The development of SatAF-MDI as alternative to brute force full-wave software constitutes the original contribution of this thesis.},

abstract = {Cathode Anode Satellite Thruster for Orbital Reposition (CASTOR) is an orbital manoeuvre and transfer micro-satellite bus developed at MIT Space System Laboratory. The technical objective of the mission is achieving 1 km/s of delta-V over a 1 year mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This will be accomplished using a novel electric propulsion system, the Diverging Cusped Field Thruster (DCFT), which enables high efficiency orbital changes of the ESPA-ring class satellite. CASTOR is capable of improving rapid access to space capabilities by providing an orbital transfer platform with a very high performance to mass ratio, thus greatly reducing launch costs and allowing for highly efficient orbital manoeuvre. Furthermore, CASTOR is highly scalable and modular, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of scales and applications. CASTOR is developed as part of the University Nanosatellite Program (UNP) funded by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). In order to accomplish CASTOR mission objective, a highly optimized, scalable, light weight, and low cost communication system needed to be developed. These constraints imply the development of trade studies to select the final communication system architecture able to maximize the amount of data transmitted, while guaranteeing reliability, redundancy and limited mass, power consumption, and cost. A special attention is also required to guarantee a reliable communication system in cases of tumbling, or in case of strong Doppler shift which is inevitable due to the high delta-V capabilities of the vehicle. In order to accomplish all the mission requirements, different features have been introduced in the design of the communication system for this mission. Specifically, customized patch antennas have been realized, and a customized communication protocol has been designed and implemented. The communication subsystem has been validated through an intense testing campaign which included software tests in the laboratory, hardware tests in anechoic chamber, and in flight tests through a balloon experiment. The article presents an overview of CASTOR mission, a presentation of the trade studies analysis and of the final communication architecture selected, a description of the customized antenna developed, of the customized protocol designed, and a presentation of the results of the tests performed.},

This paper describes a “Careful COTS” approach to component selection and testing to meet these needs. Commercial parts are selected based on best practices, and radiation tested to limits based on the modeled mission environment. High-energy proton testing allows simultaneous exploration of total dose, displacement damage, and some single-event effects. The authors have developed these methodologies over the course of a number of successful low-earth orbit missions. Provided the lifetime dose is under 30 krad, a solution can probably be realized with commercial parts. Various case studies of commercial parts that have failed under this dose are given.},

abstract = {The P-POD deployer was built and designed to provide an inexpensive, compact, and common interface between a launch vehicle and student designed pico-satellites (CubeSats). The California Polytechnic University (Cal Poly), located in San Luis Obispo, has been at the forefront of this research. In June 2003, a Russian Eurockot launch vehicle launched the first two P-PODs into orbit. Both P-PODs successfully deployed their respective CubeSats, but several CubeSats failed to transmit after their deployment. It is Cal Poly's goal to ensure that no satellite failure is attributed to the P- POD. The Test Pod was built to perform vibration tests on individual CubeSats and to qualify them for launch. The 2003 launch provided an opportunity to reevaluate the current hardware used to test the individual CubeSats. Furthermore, the launch let CubeSat developers see whether the hardware correctly simulates the environment inside the P-POD. The purpose of this thesis is to further characterize the internal and external P-POD environments and compare them with those of the Test Pod. This thesis will also investigate whether the Test Pod is a viable means to qualify satellites. It will conclude whether or not the P-POD was responsible for the failure of the satellites in the Eurockot launch. The revised testing and assembly procedures developed during the course of this investigation significantly improve the reliability and safety of the testing and certification process.},

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative space mission devoted to the survey of the small Earth companion asteroid by means of nano platforms. Also known as the second Earth Moon, Cruithne, is the target identified for the mission. Both the trajectory to reach the target and a preliminary spacecraft budget are here detailed. The idea is to exploit high efficient ion thrusters to reduce the propellant mass fraction in such a high total impulse mission (of the order of 1e6 Ns). This approach allows for a 100 kg class spacecraft with a very small Earth escape energy (5 km2/s2) to reach the destination in about 320 days. The 31{\%} propellant mass fraction allows for a payload mass fraction of the order of 8{\%} and this is sufficient to embark on such a small spacecraft a couple of nano-satellites deployed once at the target to carry out a complete survey of the asteroid. Two 2U Cubesats are here considered as representative payload, but also other scientific payloads or different platforms might be considered according with the specific mission needs. The small spacecraft used to transfer these to the target guarantees the manoeuvre capabilities during the interplanetary journey, the protection against radiations along the path and the telecommunication relay functions for the data transmission with Earth stations. The approach outlined in the paper offers reliable solutions to the main issues associated with a deep space nano-satellite mission thus allowing the exploitation of distant targets by means of these tiny spacecraft. The study presents an innovative general strategy for the NEO observation and Cruithne is chosen as test bench. This target, however, mainly for its relevant inclination, requires a relatively large propellant mass fraction that can be reduced if low inclination asteroids are of interest. This might increase the payload mass fraction (e.g. additional Cubesats and/or additional scientific payloads on the main bus) for the same 100 kg class mission.},

abstract = { For the past decade, satellite design has been an important discipline at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology. A major change of the predominantly theoretical nature of the satellite projects came into being in 2004, with the completion of an in-house Class 100.000 Clean Room. Along with equipment in laboratories located at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, this facility enables Delft University to not only design, but to actually produce and assemble a small student satellite in house as well. Learning about this affordable access to space, the space company Dutch Space approached the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering to discuss the possibility to test a new type of thin film solar cells in the space environment. In addition, the Dutch research institute TNO Science {\&} Industry showed interest to join in with an autonomous Sun Sensor using a wireless link for data transfer. A third new technology is an advanced high efficiency transceiver sized for application in pico- and nanosatellites. With these three new technologies as primary payloads and the space proven CubeSat concept as a basic principle of design, the Delfi-C3 nanosatellite is to be the first satellite that is designed and realized at Delft University of Technology. The paper discusses the Delfi-C3 mission and its design philosophy. Furthermore, a description of its subsystems and payloads is given. Delfi-C3 is scheduled for a piggyback launch by the end of 2006.},

Seeking a means to provide students with hands-on satellite devel- opment skills during their limited time at university, and inspired by the successful deployment of six 1-kg, pico-satellites from Stan- ford's Orbiting Picosatellite Automatic Launcher (OPAL) in 2000, Twiggs and Puig-Suari ultimately developed the 10-cm CubeSat. In 2003, the first successful CubeSat deployment into orbit dem- onstrated the very achievable possibilities that lay ahead. By 2008, 60 launch missions later, new industries had arisen around the CubeSat, creating new commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) satellite components and parts, and conventional launch resources became overwhelmed. Tis article recounts this history and related issues that arose, describes solutions to the issues and subsequent developments in the arena of space science (such as further min- iaturization of space research tools), and provides a glimpse of Twiggs' vision of the future of space research.},

abstract = {In this paper, a simple variation of classical Slotted Aloha is introduced and analyzed. The enhancement relies on adding multiple receivers that gather different observations of the packets transmitted by a user population in one slot. For each observation, the packets transmitted in one slot are assumed to be subject to independent on-off fading, so that each of them is either completely faded, and then does not bring any power or interference at the receiver, or it arrives unfaded, and then may or may not, collide with other unfaded transmissions. With this model, a novel type of diversity is introduced to the conventional SA scheme, leading to relevant throughput gains already for moderate number of receivers. The analytical framework that we introduce allows to derive closed-form expression of both throughput and packet loss rate an arbitrary number of receivers, providing interesting hints on the key trade-offs that characterize the system. We then focus on the problem of having receivers forward the full set of collected packets to a final gateway using the minimum possible amount of resources, i.e., avoiding delivery of duplicate packets, without allowing any exchange of information among them. We derive what is the minimum amount of resources needed and propose a scheme based on random linear network coding that achieves asymptotically this bound without the need for the receivers to coordinate among them.},

abstract = {Recently, contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) has been introduced as a simple but effective improvement to slotted ALOHA. It relies on MAC burst repetitions and on interference cancellation to increase the normalized throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. CRDSA allows achieving a larger throughput than slotted ALOHA, at the price of an increased average transmitted power. A way to trade-off the increment of the average transmitted power and the improvement of the throughput is presented in this paper. Specifically, it is proposed to divide each MAC burst in k sub-bursts, and to encode them via a (n, k) erasure correcting code. The n encoded sub-bursts are transmitted over the MAC channel, according to specific time/frequency-hopping patterns. Whenever n {\&}{\#}x2212; e {\&}{\#}x2265; k sub-bursts (of the same burst) are received without collisions, erasure decoding allows recovering the remaining e sub-bursts (which were lost due to collisions). An interference cancellation process can then take place, removing in e slots the interference caused by the e recovered sub-bursts, possibly allowing the correct decoding of sub-bursts related to other bursts. The process is thus iterated as for the CRDSA case.},

The enhanced CRDSA protocol, dubbed CRDSA++, extends the original CRDSA concept to more than two replicas (e.g. 4 or 5) and exploits power fluctuations in the received signal to further boost the performance of the CRDSA protocol. The paper provides a wide range of performance and sensitivity analysis with respect to the number of replicas and power unbalance. It is shown that a packet loss ratio (PLR) below 10-4 can be achieved with a normalized throughput in excess of 1 packet per slot. This represents a remarkable performance for an open loop random access (RA) scheme without any kind of access control over a medium shared by a large population of terminals. Finally, the paper also provides a preliminary discussion on the implementation aspects of the CRDSA++ RA scheme, as well as on the integration aspects with a DAMA protocol to support a wider range of service scenarios with improved MAC layer performance.

It relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancellation to increase the throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. This improvement permits to achieve a throughput up to T ≃ 0.55, whereas slotted ALOHA is capable of providing T ≃ 0.37. In this paper we show that the iterative interference cancellation process used in contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA can be described by a bipartite graph. Such representation permits to establish a bridge between the iterative interference cancellation process and the iterative erasure recovery process of graph-based codes. Exploiting this analogy, we show how a higher throughput (close to T ≃ 0.9) can be achieved by selecting variable burst repetition rates, leading to irregular graphs, according to given probability distributions. A framework for the probability distribution optimization is provided as well. Simulation results including the actual interference cancellation mechanism confirm the high efficiency of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {ALOHA-type protocols became a popular solution for distributed and uncoordinated multiple random access in wireless networks. However, such distributed operation of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer leads to sub-optimal utilization of the shared channel. One of the reasons is the occurrence of collisions when more than one packet is transmitted at the same time. These packets cannot be decoded and retransmissions are necessary. However, it has been recently shown that it is possible to apply signal processing techniques with these collided packets so that useful information can be decoded. This was recently proposed in the Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA), achieving a throughput T ≃ 0.97 for very large MAC frame lengths as long as the number of active users is smaller than the number of slots per frame. In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an iterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect and ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the slot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per slot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as Extended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity. Computer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the maximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of active users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show that E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC frame lengths used in practical scenarios.},

A reduced cost antenna system and low cost solid state amplifiers are used as ground station components. The spacecraft control system makes use of standard workstations, configurable software, graphical user interfaces, and automated procedure execution. The cost of the system is still further reduced by collocating both the spacecraft control system and the ground station, thus simplifying the interfaces.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SMTA. The downscaling in VLSI systems and the use of new materials influences the reliability of components in terms of radiation more and more. The unavoidable presence of particle radiation on ground and in space leads to unwanted failures in the electronic devices. Concerning packaging materials, design and technology a lot of steps were done to avoid radiation sensitivity. Nowadays microelectronic for automotive systems are tested to withstand radiation especially SEU-single event upsets. Especially since the Toyota Prius problem [1] it is clear that SEU cannot be ignored. Another application are unmanned autonomous vehicles and systems. Nevertheless reliability testing is expensive and extreme time consuming. The use of COTS-Commercials of the shelf is the ultimate goal to reach. In this paper an overview about the main influences concerning radiation hardness and COTS will be discussed. Furthermore different simulation approaches will be presented and discussed.},

Therefore, the satellite power data as well as orbital anomalies are analyzed leading to the conclusion that the satellite was temporarily (January – March 2011) orbiting with significantly increased sun exposure causing the higher temperatures. The shortened temperature peak periods are explained by alternating albedo values as the main influence in temperature changes. Typical thermal coefficients for anodized aluminum of the non-solar cell area of the spacecraft are found by performing basic thermal calculations using the critical temperature data.},

First, the stratospheric telecommunication platform is introduced, including conceptual design, configuration, energy sources, propeller and payload. Second, dynamics model of the platform is derived form the Newton–Euler formulation and the station-keeping attitude control problem is formulated. Then, the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control scheme is proposed to develop the attitude-tracking control system, with a particular focus on parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme. The proposed conceptual design and control scheme provide a promising approach for telecommunication relay missions using the stratospheric station-keeping airship.},

The general approach taken was to closely couple antenna theory and structural mechanics, to produce a deployable antenna that is considered efficient in both fields. Approaches that can be deployed using stored elastic strain energy have been favored over those that require powered actuators or environmental effects to enforce deployment. Two types of concepts were developed: thin shell structure and pantograph. These concepts cover four antenna topologies: crossed log periodic, conical log spiral, helical and quadrifilar helix. Of these, the conical log spiral antenna and the accompanying deployment concepts are determined to be the most promising approaches that warrant further study. I.},

We start by considering the simpler case of a pure MPR system without SIC, for which we provide an expression for the distribution of the number of captured packets, whose computational complexity scales with n and r. This analysis makes it possible to investigate the system throughput as a function of the MPR capabilities of the receiver. We then generalize the analysis to SIC systems. In addition to the exact expressions for the capture probability and the normalized system throughput, we also derive approximate expressions that are much easier to compute and provide accurate results in some practical scenarios. Finally, we present selected results for some case studies with the purpose of illustrating the potential of the proposed mathematical framework and validating the approximate methods.},

abstract = {With an increase in the use of small, modular, resource-limited satellites for Earth orbiting applications, the benefit to be had from a model-based architecture that rapidly searches the mission trade-space and identifies near-optimal designs is greater than ever. This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.},

abstract = {In a pico-satellite with small volume, measurements from on-board three-axis magnetometer (TAM) are not accurate, as it can be easily disturbed by other electronic systems. To improve its accuracy, a scheme of compensation methods is introduced in this article. The scheme is based on an improved measurement model of pico-satellite TAM, and it mainly consists of three steps. First, in satellite design stage, several techniques are recommended to simplify the afterwards compensations. Then after satellite assembly, TAM ground tests and pre-launch calibration with least-square batch filter are introduced to improve magnetometer performance. At the end, a post-launch calibration with unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is implemented with in-orbit data. The compensation scheme is used in the development of Chinese pico-satellite ZDPS-1A made by Zhejiang University. Results show that with the introduced compensation scheme, the maximum error of ZDPS-1A TAM can be reduced from 80 mG to 6 mG (1 G=10−4T).},

The design of a rectangular microstrip antenna is made with different dielectric materials, the choice of material is based on materials that provide good antenna performance with reduced surface wave loss. Alumina 99.5{\%}, Quartz (Fused) and Roger RT5880 are the materials for the proposed design to achieve a broader bandwidth. The design that gives voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)≤ 2 is considered the best for the proposed antenna. The antennas are simulated using Sonnet lite software.},

@article{Wood2011,
abstract = {This paper explores the process of building technological capability in government-led satellite programs within developing countries. The key message is that these satellite programs can learn useful lessons from literature in the international development community. These lessons are relevant to emerging satellite programs that leverage international partnerships in order to establish local capability to design, build and operate satellites. Countries with such programs include Algeria, Nigeria, Turkey, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. The paper first provides background knowledge about space activity in developing countries, and then explores the nuances of the lessons coming from the international development literature. Developing countries are concerned with satellite technology because satellites provide useful services in the areas of earth observation, communication, navigation and science. Most developing countries access satellite services through indirect means such as sharing data with foreign organizations. More countries, however, are seeking opportunities to develop satellite technology locally. There are objective, technically driven motivations for developing countries to invest in satellite technology, despite rich debate on this topic. The paper provides a framework to understand technical motivations for investment in satellite services, hardware, expertise and infrastructure in both short and long term. If a country decides to pursue such investments they face a common set of strategic decisions at the levels of their satellite program, their national context and their international relationships. Analysis of past projects shows that countries have chosen diverse strategies to address these strategic decisions and grow in technological capability. What is similar about the historical examples is that many countries choose to leverage international partnerships as part of their growth process. There are also historical examples from outside the space arena in which organizations have pursued technological capability. Scholars have analyzed these examples and developed insightful frameworks. The paper draws key concepts from this literature about the nature of development, technology, knowledge and organizational learning. These concepts are relevant to learning in new satellite programs, but the ideas must be applied cautiously because of the nature of satellite technology. The paper draws three major lessons from the international development literature regarding absorptive capacity, tacit knowledge and organizational learning; it synthesizes these lessons into a cohesive, original framework. The closing section proposes future work on a detailed study of technological learning in specific government satellite programs.},

abstract = {Failure analysis plays an important role in the engineering design process, as failure events are expected and need to be accounted for in any design. One technique for evaluating the potential faults that may occur within the system is known as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), a deductive method that takes an undesirable state in the system and works backwards to identify how it may have come about. The result is a logic tree that illustrates how certain faults, or combinations thereof, will lead to the undesired state. The visual nature of the FTA makes it effective in identifying the propagation of faults throughout the system; in turn, the vulnerable areas of the system can be determined and prioritized. This paper presents an overview of the ongoing Fault Tree Analysis that is being performed on the HERMES CubeSat and offers the benefits that such an FTA presents for the mission.},

abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of the relative state estimation and observability for two formation flying satellites using two different relative navigation sensor sets. The first set consists of a transmitter antenna on one satellite and a single receiver antenna on the other satellite to measure the inter-satellite range using a radiofrequency ranging signal. The second set uses three receiver antennas to measure multiple ranges, effectively providing angular information. In this paper, it is shown for the more complete sensor set that the estimation error in the relative state is a function of the pseudorange error, the inter-satellite distance, and the receiver antenna baselines. By varying these parameters, conditions are found for which the measurements obtained using the first sensor set result in relative state estimation and observability comparable to those obtained with the more complete sensor set. This offers potential reductions in cost and complexity for certain mission scenarios.},

abstract = {Bipartite graphs have been often used to describe the structure of iteratively-decodable error correcting codes, and to analyze their iterative decoding performance. This paper deals with the application of bipartite graphs to a different problem. More specifically, the bipartite graph description is applied to the iterative interference cancelation process of a recently introduced random access scheme named contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA. Contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancelation to increase the throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. The graph representation permits to establish a bridge between the iterative interference cancelation process and the iterative erasure recovery process of graph-based codes. Assuming ideal interference cancelation, it is shown how the use of irregular bipartite graphs allows achieving a throughput close to 0.97 packets/slot with a maximum burst repetition rate equal to 16. The iterative interference cancelation analysis is further extended to the case of non-ideal interference cancelation. A discussion on the normalized efficiency is provided as well, considering the average power used by the different approaches.},

abstract = {An autonomous orbit determination system for low earth orbiting spacecrafts is developed, simulation tested and examined using actual spacecraft data of the BREM-SAT mission. An extended Kalman-type filter is used to deduce a minimum error estimate of the spacecraft ephemeris by utilizing the knowledge of system and measurement dynamics, assumed statistics of system noises and measurement errors, and initial condition information. The presented algorithm is based on the laws of orbital mechanics and the measurement of geomagnetic field magnitude. Since low earth orbits are fully observable from a sufficient number of measurements of the strength of the Earth's magnetic field the determination scheme is independent of spacecraft attitude. In most cases the accuracy is sufficient for low earth orbiting satellites and moreover it can be used as a backup system to provide redundancy. Especially for small satellites the system is highly recommended because no additional hardware is required besides a magnetometer and computation time on the on-board computer.},

While the technique is well known in com- munications literature, emerging software radios are mak- ing practical experimentation feasible. This motivates us to study the extent of throughput gains possible with SIC from a MAC layer perspective. Contrary to our initial expecta- tion, we find that the gains from SIC are not easily available in many realistic situations. Moreover, we observe that the scope for SIC gets squeezed by the advances in bitrate adap- tation, casting doubt on the future of SIC based protocols.},

It was also launched as part of Humsat-D on 21st November, 2013 aboard Dnepr. The main feature of the device is its extremely light weight, achieved by using polymeric materials and additive manufacturing. Analysis was not only made of detailed characteristics but also of the advantages of using this combination, its validity after almost two years of perfect operation in orbit on Xatcobeo, and its latest operational success on Humsat-D. The results show that it deployed as expected in orbit and that it continues to operate correctly on both missions, not only in terms of the deployment mechanism but also the materials used. The analysis focuses on the mechanism's operational reliability and long useful lifetime.},

It is assumed that the satellite is actuated by a set of mutually perpendicular magnetic coils. Using well-known Lyapunov direct stability method it is shown that the proposed controller causes to a global asymptotic stable system for all near polar orbits. The design procedure is based on analyzing of the conceptual effects of magnetic coils on the satellite attitude motion. Considering these effects lead to some intuitive results which determine the global stabilizing control law. The performance and robustness of the designed controller against actuators saturation and quantization error have been verified using a real-time-hardware–software in-loop (RTHSIL) simulation results. These results show that the global stability can be achieved although some disturbances and restrictions exist. This stabilizing controller can be simply combined with a linear explicit model predictive controller (EMPC) to achieve a full three-axis control law.},

abstract = {CubeSats are currently required to follow the traditional secondary payload model. In this model, secondary payloads must identify a particular launch opportunity with a primary. The secondary payloads must commit to the launch and are subjected to any delays solely due to the primary. Additionally, this secondary payload paradigm is forcing suboptimal use of excess launch capacity since it complicates the process to add additional secondary payloads close to the launch date. This situation does not scale to support the growing demand for CubeSat launches that could potentially reach 100s of CubeSats per year within the next few years. A more flexible secondary launch model is required to support the CubeSat community and provide the fast access to space made possible by the CubeSat standard. This flexible model will allow developers to focus on the development of their spacecraft. Several key developments are necessary to reach a truly flexible secondary launch capability including technical, political, and regulatory issues. Some of the most critical are currently being addressed by work being performed by Cal Poly and their industrial and government partners.},

On the other hand, almost all space vehicles require at least one large-aperture solar array and one large-aperture telecommunication antenna in order to maintain an adequate supply of power and a robust communication link. One solution to reduce the burden of these two large apertures an the space vehicles is to combine these two structures. This paper presents the results of two antenna/solar array integration. In both designs, the printed microstrip radiator, due to its small size and low profile, was selected as the element for the antenna array to be integrated with the solar array. The first antenna/solar array integration presented uses a low-gain UHF crossed-slot microstrip radiator for future Mars rover application. The second integration uses a high-gain microstrip reflectarray at X-band for future deep-space telecommunication application.},

This project is being carried on by a cooperation between the Department of Physics, the DEEI (Dept. of Electronics) and the MED (Mech. Eng. Dept) of the University of Trieste. The scientific instrument is a silicon detector capable to monitor the radiation environment. The main goal is to build a map of the radiation's flux impinging on the instrument. The payload also includes a magnetometer and a GPS. The magnetometer provides measurements of the Earth magnetic field which are related to the Space Weather effects. The GPS allows to correlate the measurements performed by AtmoCube with those performed on Earth and from the Space. This will connect AtmoCube measures with the indexes of the Solar activity. In addition, orbital parameters obtained from GPS are used to estimate the atmospheric density. A continuous measurement along the satellite orbit provides a global atmospheric coverage and gives the possibility to analyze the correlation among the three main systems that characterize the Earth: the Sun and Solar activity, the Earth atmosphere and the terrestrial environment. Moreover the proposed detector, developed within the INFN, is supposed to fly on board future space missions dedicated to cosmic rays studies. Its use in AtmoCube can be considered an important test bench for the future utilization of the detector in space.},

abstract = {We propose an approach for information extraction for multi-page printed document understanding. The approach is designed for scenarios in which the set of possible document classes, i.e., documents sharing similar content and layout, is large and may evolve over time. Describing a new class is a very simple task: the operator merely provides a few samples and then, by means of a GUI, clicks on the OCR-generated blocks of a document containing the information to be extracted. Our approach is based on probability: we derived a general form for the probability that a sequence of blocks contains the searched information. We estimate the parameters for a new class by applying the maximum likelihood method to the samples of the class. All these parameters depend only on block properties that can be extracted automatically from the operator actions on the GUI. Processing a document of a given class consists in finding the sequence of blocks, which maximizes the corresponding probability for that class. We evaluated experimentally our proposal using 807 multi-page printed documents of different domains (invoices, patents, data-sheets), obtaining very good results—e.g., a success rate often greater than 90{\%} even for classes with just two samples.},

abstract = {The MEROPE communications subsystem consists almost entirely of commercial off the shelf components. Simple and robust, it is centered around a Paccomm Picopacket terminal node controller (TNC) operating continuously in "transparent" mode, whereby all serial data from the processor are immediately packetized and transmitted through a Yaesu VX-1R dual-band radio. The entire subsystem weighs less than 140 grams and occupies a total volume (including antennas and interconnects) of 180 cm3 - less than 1/5 of the total spacecraft weight and volume budgets - with a hardware cost of less than {\$}400. MEROPE communications uses the AX.25 packet radio protocol at 1200 baud. Uplink is at a frequency of 145.835 MHz with 20 kHz of available bandwidth. Downlink is at 437.445 MHz with a 30 kHz bandwidth. Communications flow is controlled by the Motorola HC12 flight processor, which is linked through a 9600 baud RS232 serial connection to the TNC. The entire communications link (ground-MEROPE-ground) is seamless, initialized by a single encrypted uplink command. The MEROPE antenna is a center-fed dipole tuned to the 2m uplink, which is nearly harmonic with the 70 cm downlink.},

abstract = {An accurate and flexible iterative algorithm of power synthesis for reconfigurable arrays is proposed. The algorithm is based on an alternating projection approach, and is suitable for arrays of arbitrary geometry, thus including conformal and sparse arrays. It allows to generate a number of copolar and crosspolar radiation patterns satisfying assigned requirements, switching each pattern into any of the others by phase-only control of the excitation applied to each array element. Moreover, the algorithm allows to reduce the dynamic range ratio (DRR) of the excitations and the maximum electric field amplitude in a region close to the antenna. A modified version of this algorithm including the previous one as a particular case, is then proposed, which introduces, as an additional capability, the reduction of the power radiated in the side lobe region, in presence of the above constraints, and the squared amplitude of the electric field in an assigned region close to the antenna. This allows to significantly improve the final results. Numerical examples, including a comparison with existing literature, show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {A technique for computing the field of short-term glacier surface motion on a local scale is presented. Time-lapsed image negatives, digitized to a high resolution, provide the raw data for the three-stage technique. First, cross-correlation is used to establish a number of candidate displacement vectors for a series of regularly spaced templates. A relaxation-labeling routine is then applied to select the most appropriate candidate vectors, according to the local flow. Novel aspects of the relaxation algorithm include a new, efficient form of the support function and the absence of a null-match category. A new development is the application of a post filter to the resultant flow field, providing suitable displacement vectors for templates that were originally unmatched and correcting vectors that are still inconsistent with the local flow. Results from an image sequence from New Zealand's Mount Cook National Park show the superiority of the technique over the maximum cross-correlation method and demonstrate the effectiveness of the post filter in improving correlation-relaxation labeling},

abstract = {A high-directivity transponder system uses a dual system of a retrodirective array transmitting a data signal peak toWard an interrogator source, and a self-null-steering array trans mitting a null toWard the interrogator source and a jamming signal elsewhere, resulting in high S/N reception at the interrogator source and avoidance of interception. Integrat ing modulators Would alloW each array to transmit di?ferent data While the spectra of the transmitted signals are identical, thus disabling interception. The system enables secure point-to-point communications and can be used for short distance Wireless data transmission systems such as Wireless LAN and RFID servers. One mobile may send a broadcast interrogator signal, causing the other mobile devices to send a reply signal back to the interrogating mobile device only in the direction of the interrogating mobile device, such that each of the other mobile devices identi?es its position to only the interrogating mobile device in response to its broadcast interrogator signal. As another aspect, self-steer ing signal transmission is employed for randomly oriented satellites using circularly polarized, two-dimensional retro directive arrays. Quadruple subharmonic mixing is used as an e?‘ective means of achieving phase conjugation When a high-frequency L0 is not feasible or inapplicable. These features may be used for small-satellite communications, secure tactical communications, search and rescue, enemy location ?xing and tracking, UAV command and control, forest ?re detection, marine-based tracking, and many other applications requiring secure communications With high signal directivity.},

By using corner-truncated square patch as the array element and adopting appropriate level of sequential rotation series-parallel feeding structures as feeding networks, microstrip arrays can generate excellent circular polarization (CP) over a relativelywide frequency band.

A few local companies are participating in the project allowing a direct contact between research and industrial field. The main goal is to measure the Earth magnetic field and map the radiation flux. Orbital parameters from a GPS are used to estimate the atmospheric density. An agile mission as AtmoCube can be considered as a precursor of a series of small scientific missions for the analysis of the Earth atmosphere at very low costs and can play a pioneering role in the low-cost probes of the Sun- Atmosphere-Earth system. The project has a strong educational interest: students improve their scientific and technical knowledge by personally designing the satellite sub-systems. The status of the first AtmoCube satellite is described here with special attention to the lesson learned during the four years of AtmoCube development and possible future AtmoCube-2 missions.},

It appears as a cubic nano-satellite that has dimensions of 10×10×10 cm3 with a total weight of 1 kg (aluminium structure). The main scientific instrument is a spectral dosimeter-radiometer allowing continuous monitoring of the radiation environment. The payload includes also a magnetometer belonging to the passive stabilization system. A GPS (Global Positioning System) provides a continuous measurement of the satellite position and allows us to build a map of the measured atmospheric parameters. The goal is to build a precise map of the Earth's magnetic field and of the flux of radiation impinging on the instrument, which is related to space weather effects. The GPS, providing the position of the region where the measurements are performed and the corresponding time instant, allows us to correlate these measurements with other measurements performed on Earth and from space and therefore with the indexes of the solar activity. In addition the GPS allows an indirect measurement of the atmospheric density. It has been decided to use an international platform, CubeSat, a "quasi standard" structure that allows to start from a well consolidated basis. CubeSat is an international program and network that has educative purposes and is already in the production phase in the United States and in Japan. In Norway and Germany the program has started. With AtmoCube, Italy can become an active member of the CubeSat network.},

abstract = {We elaborate the design and simulation of a planar antenna that is suitable for CubeSat picosatellites. The antenna operates at 436 MHz and its main features are miniature size and the built-in capability to produce circular polarization. The miniaturization procedure is given in detail, and the electrical performance of this small antenna is documented. Two main miniaturization techniques have been applied, i.e. dielectric loading and distortion of the current path. We have added an extra degree of freedom to the latter. The radiator is integrated with the chassis of the picosatellite and, at the same time, operates at the lower end of the UHF spectrum. In terms of electrical size, the structure presented herein is one of the smallest antennas that have been proposed for small satellites. Despite its small electrical size, the antenna maintains acceptable efficiency and gain performance in the band of interest.},

abstract = {To acquire a knowledge of radio propagation characteristics in the microcellular environments for personal communications services (PCS), a comprehensive measurement program was conducted by Telesis Technologies Laboratory (TTL) in the San Francisco Bay area using three base station antenna heights of 3.2 m, 8.7 m, and 13.4 m and two frequencies at 900 MHz and 1900 MHz. Five test settings were chosen in urban, suburban, and rural areas in order to study propagation in a variety of environments. This paper reports the LOS measurements in different environments, all of which show variations of signal strength with distance that have distinct near and far regions separated by a break point. It was also found that the location of the break point for different frequencies and antenna heights can be calculated based on first Fresnel zone clearance. The regression analysis reveals a slope that is less than two before the break point, while it is greater than two after the break point. This break distance can be used to define the size of microcell and to design for fast hand-off. Beyond the first Fresnel zone break distance the base station antenna height gain was observed to approximately follow the square power law of antenna height},

Intersatellite links have been considered for satellite constellation missions involving earth observation and communications. Historically, a large satellite system has needed an extremely high financial budget. However, the advent of the successful CubeSat platform allows for small satellites of less than one kilogram. This low-mass pico-satellite class platform could provide financially feasible support for large platform satellite constellations. This article surveys past and planned large intersatellite linking systems. Then, the article chronicles CubeSat communication subsystems used historically and in the near future. Finally, we examine the history of inter-networking protocols in space and open research issues with the goal of moving towards the next generation intersatellite-linking constellation supported by CubeSat platform satellites.},

We consider a fully connected network where each user acts as both transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex mode. Users attempt to exchange messages with each other and to establish one-to-one handshakes, in the sense that each user decides whether its packet was successfully received by the other users: After performing decoding, each user estimates in which slots the resolved users transmitted their packets and, based on that, decides if these users successfully received its packet. The simulation results show that the proposed handshake algorithm allows the users to reliably perform the handshake. The paper also provides some analytical bounds on the performance of the proposed algorithm which are in good agreement with the simulation results.},

The theory is compared to some experimental results reported by other investigators to determine its range of application. The diffraction formula given is theoretically valid only at the lower frequencies; however, it was shown that sky waves are important both day and night and over land and sea at those distances where diffraction would otherwise cause a marked decrease in the received field intensity. The attenuation formula given for the short distances where diffraction may be nelgected is theoretically valid for any frequency and set of ground constants; experimental data are given which show that the formula may be used even at the ultra-high frequencies.},

abstract = {Recently a new Random Access technique based on Aloha and using Interference Cancellation (IC) named Sliding Window Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha (SW-CRDSA) has been introduced. Differently from classic CRDSA that operates grouping slots in frames, this technique operates in an unframed manner yielding to better throughput results and smaller average packet delay with respect to frame-based CRDSA. However as classic CRDSA also SW-CRDSA relies on multiple transmission of the same packet. While this can be acceptable in systems where the only limit resides in the peak transmission power, it could represent a problem when constraints on the average power (e.g. at the transponder of a satellite system) are present. In this paper, a comparison in terms of normalized efficiency is carried out between Slotted Aloha and the two CRDSA techniques.},

abstract = {The Surrey Space Centre is currently working on CubeSail, a 5×5 m2 nano-solar sail spacecraft to be fitted inside a 3U Cubesat platform. The CubeSail mission has a two-fold aim: first, to demonstrate the concept of solar sailing using a 3-axis stabilized sail and second, to demonstrate the potential use of its large membrane as a drag augmentation device for de-orbiting satellites and launch vehicles' upper stages in low Earth orbit (LEO). The novel solar sail concept presented here is a result of the highly restrictive area-to-mass ratio and volume constraints imposed by the mission requirements. Therefore, this concept can be readily scaled up to produce future very high performance sailcrafts. Research on ultra-lightweight deployable structures leads to the invention of a new bi-stable composite boom that entails a light and simple deployment subsystem. This simplicity is the key feature that enables the sail to be attached along the length of the booms, thus reducing the structural mass requirement of these support structures. In the completely stripped sail concept the previously considered square or quadrant membrane is split into a set of parallel strips, in order to achieve a uniaxial tension state in the film. Also, a test-bed created for the successful deployment under gravity conditions of the 5 m2 prototype sail is presented.},

abstract = {An effective way to solve the issue of global warming is reduction of CO2 emissions through its capture from stationary sources of energy production. A large amount can be stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs being mixed with impurities and hydrocarbons in states close to the critical point. Thermodiffusion may result in accumulation of chemically active impurities near the bottom of the cap rock, thus leading to provoke leakages. The objective of the KIBILI project aims to study the kinetic of the mass transport in a binary mixture in the gas/liquid critical region. The measurements of diffusion and Soret coefficients are foreseen to be carried out in a CO2–hydrocarbon system, which could be representative of those mixtures stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. The microgravity conditions provided by nano-satellites of the project QB50 would be a very nice opportunity to realize accurate measurements of these delicate phenomena.},

abstract = {We present a general method for determining the capacity of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under message-passing decoding when used over any binary-input memoryless channel with discrete or continuous output alphabets. Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. (By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate.) Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy. The ideas presented in this paper are broadly applicable and extensions of the general method to low-density parity-check codes over larger alphabets, turbo codes, and other concatenated coding schemes are outlined},

abstract = {In this paper, coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) is introduced as a powerful random access scheme to the MAC frame. In CSA, the burst a generic user wishes to transmit in the MAC frame is first split into segments, and these segments are then encoded through a local a packet-oriented code prior to transmission. On the receiver side, iterative interference cancellation combined with decoding of the local code is performed to recover from collisions. The new scheme generalizes the previously proposed irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) technique, based on a simple repetition of the users' bursts. An interpretation of the CSA interference cancellation process as an iterative erasure decoding process over a sparse bipartite graph is identified, and the corresponding density evolution equations derived. Based on these equations, asymptotically optimal CSA schemes are designed for several rates and their performance for a finite number of users investigated through simulation and compared to IRSA competitors. Throughputs as high as 0.8 are demonstrated. The new scheme turns out to be a good candidate in contexts where power efficiency is required.},

This project is being carried on by a cooperation among the Department of Physics, the Department of Industrial Enginering and Information Technology of the University of Trieste, INAF, INFN and MatHiTech. The primary payload consists of a silicon detector capable of monitoring the radiation environment. The main goal, indeed, is to build a map of the radiation flux impinging on the instrument. The secondary payload includes a magnetometer and a GPS; the magnetometer will provide measurements of the Earth magnetic field (the same data are used both for scientific purposes and attitude determination) , which is related to the Space Weather effects, while the correlation between the measurements performed by AtmoCube with those performed on Earth and from the Space is possible using the GPS data. Other than the payloads, AtmoCube includes boards dedicated to: power generation and management (with triple junctions solar cells and a lithium battery), attitude determination and control (by means of a magneto torquer), radio communications, on board control and data handling (based on a PIC family microcontroller and PicOs real time operating system). On the ground segment side, at INAF - Osservatorio di Basovizza, is on its way of completion the Ground Station, expected also to be integrated in the ESA Global Education Network for Space Operations (GENSO). This project has a great educational value, being a collaboration between academic departments, research institutes and local companies, and having more than 35 students who spent their degree work within the team, improving their technical knowledge and capabilities in the design and verification of one or more subsystems.},

abstract = {New microcellular systems have been proposed to operate over short radio paths by using low-base station antennas, and transmitting at low power. In order to study radio propagation in the microcellular environments for future personal communications services (PCS), comprehensive radio propagation measurements were conducted by Telesis Technologies Laboratory (TTL) in the San Francisco Bay area using three transmitting antenna heights of 3.2, 8.7, and 13.4 m and two frequencies in the 900 and 1900 MHz bands. The paper reports the path loss measurements made in urban and suburban areas where the receiving mobile was driven along preselected line-of-sight (LOS), zig-zag, and staircase routes to gather information about direct propagation along streets, as well as diffraction over the roofs in suburban areas, and diffraction around the corners in urban areas. The results obtained for the three antenna heights are studied, and show the height gain that can be expected for microcells in different environments},

abstract = {Electron data (0.1 to 1.7 MeV) from the Medium Electrons A spectrometer on CRRES were used to train neural networks to predict daily averages of energetic fluxes at 5 energies and 6 L-values using the daily sum of the Kp magnetic field index. The trained networks were then used to process the entire Kp index from 1932 to 1996 (six complete solar cycles), providing daily estimates of the electron fluxes for the entire period. Superposed-epoch analysis of the six cycles shows the fluxes are minimum about six months after the solar sunspot minimum and maximize about three years after sunspot maximum. The variation over the solar cycle is about a factor of 2.3. Specific outputs from the study include long-term averages of fluxes, peak flux vs. energy and L, and flux vs. frequency-of-occurrence tables. The outputs were then used to generate a new model, ESA-SEE1, as an update to AE8. This study indicates that AE8 has excessive fluxes above 1 MeV beyond L=5.5, with the discrepancy being an order of magnitude at geosynchronous orbit. The high energy electrons peak in L about 0.5 L lower than indicated by AE8},

abstract = {In this paper, an extended version of the CRDSA protocol proposed in and is presented. The enhanced CRDSA protocol, dubbed CRDSA++, extends the original CRDSA concept to more than two replicas (e.g. 4 or 5) and exploits power fluctuations in the received signal to further boost the performance of the CRDSA protocol. The paper provides a wide range of performance and sensitivity analysis with respect to the number of replicas and power unbalance. It is shown that a packet loss ratio (PLR) below 10-4 can be achieved with a normalized throughput in excess of 1 packet per slot. This represents a remarkable performance for an open loop random access (RA) scheme without any kind of access control over a medium shared by a large population of terminals. Finally, the paper also provides a preliminary discussion on the implementation aspects of the CRDSA++ RA scheme, as well as on the integration aspects with a DAMA protocol to support a wider range of service scenarios with improved MAC layer performance.

It has been selected by ESA to be launched in 2010 as one of the educational payloads on the Maiden Flight of the Vega launcher.

Despite that AtmoCube has been conceived as a technology demonstration, it has been provided with a scientific payload composed of a GPS module, a vector magnetometer and a drift-chamber particle detector. In fact, AtmoCube is intended to probe the Earth's atmosphere, the geomagnetic field and the radiation environment at the altitudes relevant to its orbital path.

These measurements are of great interest to space weather applications. Hence a successful mapping of the derived physical parameters will prove the effectiveness of this small-size, low-cost bus for monitoring purposes, and will allow to define its potentialities and its limitations in this context.

In this work, we provide a status report of the development and we elaborate on expected results relevant to space weather science and applications.},

These satellites are small and light, thanks to their cubic shape they are also modular and have raised the interest of space operators thanks to their jack-in-the-box concept. Particularly interesting is the Earth Observation and remote sensing segment, that has large potential applications for safety issues, or even more practical applications for agriculture. The possibility of using a constellation or a network of nano-satellites as a new generation of telecommunication (e.g. for mobile applications) or navigation systems seems also very appealing for the next future. Besides the advantages of using nano-satellites, this type of space missions still presents a number of technical issues; one of these is the on-board telecommunication system that, working at low frequencies, provides a very limited data rate preventing the transmission of large amounts of data. Only by improving this system, nano-satellites can become real science space missions.},

Global Positioning System (GPS) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from a
single antenna mounted on a near-Earth satellite. It comprises a
calibration procedure and a single-point optimal solution for the
orientation of the antenna boresight vector. The calibration step
creates an empirical mapping of the SNR to the angle between the antenna
boresight and the GPS line-of-sight vector, based upon a ground or
flight data set. The rms attitude accuracy at the level of
3°-10° is demonstrated with actual flight data from several
spacecraft. Performance is shown to depend strongly on the number of GPS
signals available and the quality of the calibration mapping function.
The method is suitable as a backup attitude sensor for low-cost
satellite and terrestrial applications, and as a coarse reference for
ambiguity resolution and integrity verification of phase-based GPS

Since most CubeSats currently transmit at a 437 MHz frequency, several directional antenna types were studied for a 2.45 GHz, larger bandwidth transmission. This higher frequency provides the bandwidth needed for increasing the data rate. A deployable antenna mecha- nism maybe needed because most directional antennas are bigger than the CubeSat size constraints. From the study, a deployable hemispherical helical antenna prototype was built. Transmission between two prototype antenna equipped transceivers at varying distances tested the helical performance. When comparing the prototype antenna's maximum transmission distance to the other commercial antennas, the prototype outperformed all commercial antennas, except the patch antenna. The root cause was due to the helical antenna's narrow beam width. Future work can be done in attaining a more accurate alignment with the satellite's directional antenna to downlink with a terrestrial ground station.},

abstract = {State-of-charge (SOC) determination becomes an increasingly important issue in all the applications that include a battery. Former operation strategies made use of voltage limits only to protect the battery against deep discharge and overcharge. Currently, battery operation is changing to what could rather be called battery management than simply protection. For this improved battery control, the battery SOC is a key factor. Much research work has been done in recent years to improve SOC determination. Operational conditions differ for batteries in, for example, photovoltaic applications, (hybrid)-electric vehicles or telecommunications. Hence, a given method for SOC calculation will be more suitable for a certain application than for another. The authors introduce commonly used methods for SOC determination and establish a relationship between the advantages of the different methods and the most common applications. As a main illustration, the analysis of Kalman filter technique for lead-acid battery SOC determination are presented and some results for other calculation methods as well.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effect of spatial coupling applied to the recently-proposed coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) random access protocol. Thanks to the bridge between the graphical model describing the iterative interference cancellation process of CSA over the random access frame and the erasure recovery process of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), we propose an access protocol which is inspired by the convolutional LDPC code construction. The proposed protocol exploits the terminations of its graphical model to achieve the spatial coupling effect, attaining performance close to the theoretical limits of CSA. As for the convolutional LDPC code case, large iterative decoding thresholds are obtained by simply increasing the density of the graph. We show that the threshold saturation effect takes place by defining a suitable counterpart of the maximum-a-posteriori decoding threshold of spatially-coupled LDPC code ensembles. In the asymptotic setting, the proposed scheme allows sustaining a traffic close to 1 [packets/slot].},

@inproceedings{Munari2013,
abstract = {In this paper, a simple variation of classical Slotted Aloha is introduced and analyzed. The enhancement relies on adding multiple receivers that gather different observations of the packets transmitted by a user population in one slot. For each observation, the packets transmitted in one slot are assumed to be subject to independent on-off fading, so that each of them is either completely faded, and then does not bring any power or interference at the receiver, or it arrives unfaded, and then may or may not, collide with other unfaded transmissions. With this model, a novel type of diversity is introduced to the conventional SA scheme, leading to relevant throughput gains already for moderate number of receivers. The analytical framework that we introduce allows to derive closed-form expression of both throughput and packet loss rate an arbitrary number of receivers, providing interesting hints on the key trade-offs that characterize the system. We then focus on the problem of having receivers forward the full set of collected packets to a final gateway using the minimum possible amount of resources, i.e., avoiding delivery of duplicate packets, without allowing any exchange of information among them. We derive what is the minimum amount of resources needed and propose a scheme based on random linear network coding that achieves asymptotically this bound without the need for the receivers to coordinate among them.},

Using this inner bound as a feasible set of achievable rates, a characterization of the throughput--fairness tradeoff over this set is obtained, where throughput is defined as the sum of the individual user rates, and two definitions of fairness are considered: the Jain-Chiu-Hawe function and the sum-user alpha-fair (isoelastic) utility function. This characterization is obtained using both an equality constraint and an inequality constraint on the throughput, and properties of the optimal controls, the optimal rates, and the fairness as a function of the target throughput are established. A key fact used in all theorems is the observation that all contention probability vectors that extremize the fairness functions take at most two non-zero values.},

@phdthesis{Rights2012,
abstract = {This thesis addresses the problem of task allocation in a distributed satellite system. These spacecraft specialise in different functions, and must collaborate to complete the mission objectives. The energy available for task execution and communication is, however, extremely limited, which poses a challenging design problem. I propose the use of a market-based, multi-agent approach to achieve the necessary macro-level behaviour. The development and verification of this allocation mechanism constitutes the first major objective of this thesis. Although numerous examples of task allocation in related systems exist, I found a worrying disconnect between our general, theoretical knowledge of task allocation, and the specific application thereof. General analyses of abstracted task allocation exist, and specific implementations have been constructed in a heuristic way, but very little work navigates between these two extremes. My second major objective therefore contributes to mapping the problem space. The proposed task allocation mechanism is based on human labour markets in order to obtain similar robustness and flexibility. It uses fully distributed auctions to efficiently allocate tasks in volatile networks, without any global knowledge of the system state. The energy required for communication is con- stant, irrespective of the size of the network, resulting in a highly scalable allocation mechanism. To find the area in parameter space where market-based control is the more suitable solution, when compared to a centralised approach, I characterised the allocation mechanism in terms of network size, node failure rate, and robust- ness. The relationship between communication cost and topology is explored by looking at the overheads associated with different static topologies, and the impact of communication distance. The ability of the allocation mechanism to cope with realistic Keplerian dynamics is also confirmed. Finally, I investigate the difference in performance between the allocation mechanism, as an exam- ple of a cooperative market, and a competitive scenario where adaptive agents compete to maximise their revenue. Results show that competitive markets are subject to positive feedback loops which can result in inferior performance for sparsely connected and heavily loaded networks. This exploration of the system parameters is treated as a traversal of the problem space, resulting in an emergent taxonomy of both problem and solution elements.},

This study applies commercial software for the automatic generation of elevation models from digital imagery and presents a newly developed tool for digital measurement of surface displacements from repeated orthophotos. The accuracy and quality of automatically-derived geometry and velocity data are compared to conventionally-derived elevation and velocity data from the Muragl rock glacier in the Swiss Alps. The analysis reveals that for thickness changes and velocities digital photogrammetry provides at least the same accuracy as the reference data. Under unfavourable terrain and image conditions, such as steep slopes, shadows or snow cover, the reliability of the automatically-derived data is significantly lower than the operator-measured ones.

abstract = {AtmoCube belongs to the class of CubeSat nano-satellites. It represents an innovative and low-cost measurement system to study the near-Earth space environment. This project is carried out by a cooperation between the Departments of Physics and Industrial Engineering and Information Technology of the University of Trieste with the involvement of the Istituto Nazionale di AstroFisica and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare. A few local companies are participating in the project allowing a direct contact between research and industrial field. The main goal is to measure the Earth magnetic field and map the radiation flux. Orbital parameters from a GPS are used to estimate the atmospheric density. An agile mission as AtmoCube can be considered as a precursor of a series of small scientific missions for the analysis of the Earth atmosphere at very low costs and can play a pioneering role in the low-cost probes of the Sun- Atmosphere-Earth system. The project has a strong educational interest: students improve their scientific and technical knowledge by personally designing the satellite sub-systems. The status of the first AtmoCube satellite is described here with special attention to the lesson learned during the four years of AtmoCube development and possible future AtmoCube-2 missions.},

abstract = {Small satellites, weighting between 100 and 200 kg, have witnessed increasing use for a variety of space applications including remote sensing constellations and technology demonstrations. The energy storage/stored power demands of most spacecraft, including small satellites, are currently accommodated by rechargeable batteries—typically nickel–cadmium cells (specific energy of 50 Wh kg−1), or more recently lithium-ion cells (150 Wh kg−1). High energy density is a primary concern for spacecraft energy storage design, and these batteries have been sufficient for most applications. However, constraints on the allowable on-board battery size have limited peak power performance such that the maximum power supply capability of small satellites currently ranges between only 70 and 200 W. This relatively low maximum power limits the capabilities of small satellites in terms of payload design and selection. In order to enhance these satellites' power performance, the research reported in this paper focused on the implementation of super-capacitors as practical rechargeable energy storage medium, and as an alternative to chemical batteries. Compared to batteries, some super-capacitors are able to supply high power at high energy-efficiency, but unfortunately they still have a very low energy density (5–30 Wh kg−1). However, the provision of this high power capability would considerably widen the range of small satellite applications.},

@article{Babuscia2012,
abstract = {For more than a decade, the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at MIT has offered undergraduate students the opportunity of conceiving, developing, implementing and operating new spacecraft's missions. During a three term class, junior and senior students experience all the challenges of a true engineering team project: design, analysis, testing, technical documentation development, team management, and leadership. Leadership instruction is an important part of the curricula; through the development of leadership skills, students learn to manage themselves and each other in a more effective way, increasing the overall productivity of the team. Also, a strong leadership education is a key factor in improving the abilities of future engineers to be effective team members and leaders in the companies and agencies in which they will work. However, too often leadership instruction is presented in an abstract way, which does not provide students with suggestions for immediate applicability. As a consequence, students underestimate the potential that leadership education can have on the development of their projects. To counteract that effect, a new approach for teaching “practical” leadership has been developed. This approach is composed of a set of activities developed to improve students' leadership skills in the context of a project. Specifically, this approach has been implemented in the MIT satellite development class. In that class, students experienced the challenges of building two satellites: CASTOR and Exoplanet. These two missions are real space projects which will be launched in the next two years, and which involve cooperation with different entities (MIT, NASA, and Draper). Hence, the MIT faculty was interested in developing leadership activities to improve the productivity of the teams in a short time. In fact, one of the key aspects of the approach proposed is that it can be quickly implemented in a single semester, requiring no more than 4 h of activity. Data collected show that the approach improved the ability of students to interact productively with each other. This suggests that the activity can also be used in different contexts where a rapid and effective way of improving leadership and team membership is required. The article presents an overview of MIT satellite development class and of the two missions used as test cases, a detailed description of the leadership approach implemented, and of the results obtained.},

Now, CubeSats are being proven to be an effective small satellite design, which have the ability to be easily modified to accommodate larger academic and even commercial scientific missions. QuakeSat, a small satellite currently being developed by the Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL) at Stanford University will be launched to study earthquake precursor phenomena from space. QuakeSat's primary scientific mission is to detect, record, and downlink Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) magnetic signal data, which may lead to groundbreaking techniques to predict earthquake activity. Set to launch in 2003, and bound for a 650 km sun-synchronous orbit, QuakeSat is a prime example of CubeSat technology, which utilizes commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) components originally used in non-space applications and using them for scientific experiments and payloads, providing a low cost alternative to launch space missions, and support small-satellite infrastructure in the near future.},

abstract = {A generalization of the slotted ALOHA random access scheme is considered in which a user transmits multiple copies of the same packet. The multiple copies can be either transmitted simultaneously on different frequency channels (frequency diversity) or they may be transmitted on a single high-speed channel but spaced apart by random time intervals (time diversity). In frequency diversity, two schemes employing channel selections with and without replacements have been considered. In time diversity, two schemes employing a fixed number of copies or a random number of copies for each packet have been considered. In frequency diversity, activity factor-throughput tradeoffs and in time diversity, delay-throughput tradeoffs for various diversity orders have been compared. It is found that under light traffic, multiple transmission gives better delay performance. If the probability that a packet fails a certain number or more times is specified not to exceed some time limit (realistic requirement for satellite systems having large round trip propagation delay), then usually multiple transmission gives higher throughput.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effect of spatial coupling applied to the recently-proposed coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) random access protocol. Thanks to the bridge between the graphical model describing the iterative interference cancellation process of CSA over the random access frame and the erasure recovery process of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), we propose an access protocol which is inspired by the convolutional LDPC code construction. The proposed protocol exploits the terminations of its graphical model to achieve the spatial coupling effect, attaining performance close to the theoretical limits of CSA. As for the convolutional LDPC code case, large iterative decoding thresholds are obtained by simply increasing the density of the graph. We show that the threshold saturation effect takes place by defining a suitable counterpart of the maximum-a-posteriori decoding threshold of spatially-coupled LDPC code ensembles. In the asymptotic setting, the proposed scheme allows sustaining a traffic close to 1 [packets/slot].},

Programming a microcontroller, even in a high level language, requires accessibility to various peripheral registers, ability to fix placement of both program and data, and exact knowledge of memory types and organization, stack usage and interrupt handling. C compilers for microcontrollers are forced to include extensions to accommodate these hardware-specific aspects. The trend towards adoption of high-level languages has had an effect on both development tools suppliers and silicon suppliers. Historically, compilers have never been outstandingly efficient with respect to their `code bloat' ratio (the somewhat hypothetical ratio of a good hand-coded assembly version to the actual executable generated by the compiler). There has however been much evidence recently that compiler developers are improving by leaps and bounds. This article briefly discusses some of the improvements which have been accomplished in most compilers lately},

Whiskers grow spontaneously without an applied electric field or moisture (unlike dendrites) and independent of atmo- spheric pressure (they grow in vacuum). Whiskers may be straight, kinked, hooked, or forked and some are reported to be hollow. Their outer surfaces are usually striated. Whiskers can grow in nonfilament types which are sometimes called lumps or flowers. Whisker growth may begin soon after plating. However, initiation of growth may also take years. The unpredictable nature of whisker incubation and subse- quent growth is of particular concern to systems requiring long term, reliable operation.},

abstract = {In this paper we review key properties of proposed high performance protocols for random access (RA) satellite channels for both time division and code division multiple access (TDMA/CDMA) techniques. The proposed protocols by far outperform traditional satellite random access techniques without the need for quick feedback from the gateway. This makes possible to avoid the utilization of demand assigned capacity for the transmission of small/medium size bursts of packets. A fair comparative performance of state-of-the-art TDMA and CDMA RA schemes is provided together with a summary of their key performance results. It is shown that the proposed enhanced RA protocols, although different between TDMA and CDMA, share commonalities as they exploit iterative interference cancellation at the demodulator side and demonstrate to provide even better performance in the presence of received carrier power unbalance. Typical application scenarios of these enhanced random access protocols are then illustrated, as well as possible ways to combine random access and demand assigned protocols.},

The main FITSAT-1 mission was to demonstrate a high speed transmitter module developed by our group (115.2kbps, 5.84GHz, FSK, 2W RF output). Each of the JPEG VGA images (640×480 pixels) taken at the time of deployment was received in 2 to 6 seconds. The second mission was to make the satellite twinkle as an “artificial star” using high-output LEDs and investigate the possibility of visible light communication between a satellite and the ground. This light from the satellite was photographed in many places. Our FITSAT team succeeded in acquiring the light signal using a photomultiplier attached to a telescope. Moreover, we discovered that the FITSAT-1 rotation speed gradually increased.},

The requirements of an intersatellite link are analyzed based on frequency, modulation, antenna, power and network protocol.

abstract = {1kg satellites, called CubeSats, are small and cheap enough that most universities are able to design and build them as fully functional satellites. Designing satellite systems in this new, small, and lightweight design presents a new challenge to satellite developers. This thesis describes the design of a flexible electronic power system (EPS) and Command and Data Handling (C{\&}DH) system capable of interfacing to many different payloads. The power system is designed to be robust with a fault tolerant architecture. The solar panels are individually peak power tracked for optimal performance and are each fused for short circuit protection. Redundant batteries are used with individual safety circuits so that if either battery has an internal short or open, that battery can be disconnected from the power bus and the other battery can continue to operate normally. The electrical loads are isolated from each other through the use of multiple DC-DC converters and “smart fuses.” The C{\&}DH system is designed with a two wire serial bus that transports critical data between more than 20 devices on the spacecraft. The C{\&}DH processor controls data flow on the bus and is able to isolate bus branches in case a failure prevents bus iv operation. Nine data acquisition circuits throughout the satellite monitor over 70 different sensors giving satellite health and status. By designing circuits that mirror the operation and capability of larger and more complex satellite systems, CubeSats such as this are able to distribute power, communicate with ground stations, and perform scientific missions in much the same way as their larger brethren. The power system and C{\&}DH system described in this thesis has been built into the CubeSat CP2. CP2 has been built and is currently under final testing at Cal Poly. The design modifications listed in chapter 4 of this thesis represent most of the important design modifications on CP2's electronics at the time this thesis is written.},

abstract = {Small satellites, especially Cube Satellites (CubeSats), have become important vehicles for space exploration. One of the challenges CubeSats face is limited surface area. This limitation poses a question for antenna design–where to mount the antenna? This thesis presents a study where the antennas are directly integrated on top of solar cells. In order to achieve such integration, the antennas have to be highly transparent to light. This thesis aims at the transparency of 95{\%}. Methods to effectively generate transparent antenna by using inkjet printing are discussed in detail and interaction between solar cells and antennas have been assessed and presented. It is found that the presence of solar cells cast a degree of gain reduction of the antenna, but such a loss may be improved with a more precise integration and by increasing the operational frequency. The effect of the antenna on solar cell performance is concluded to be less than 3{\%}, promising a feasibility of implementing highly transparent antennas on CubeSats.},

Recent studies show that this unfairness is due to local differences in the neighborhood structure: nodes with fewer neighbors receive better access. We study the unfairness in saturated linear networks, and adapt the random-access CSMA protocol to remove the unfairness completely, by choosing the activation rates of nodes as a specific function of the number of neighbors. We then investigate the consequences of this choice of activation rates on the network-average saturated throughput, and we show that these rates perform well in non-saturated settings.},

abstract = {Various applications of wireless Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications have rekindled the research interest in random access protocols, suitable to support a large number of connected devices. Slotted ALOHA and its derivatives represent a simple solution for distributed random access in wireless networks. Recently, a framed version of slotted ALOHA gained renewed interest due to the incorporation of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in the scheme, which resulted in substantially higher throughputs. Based on similar principles and inspired by the rateless coding paradigm, a frameless approach for distributed random access in the slotted ALOHA framework is described in this paper. The proposed approach shares an operational analogy with rateless coding, expressed both through the user access strategy and the adaptive length of the contention period, with the objective to end the contention when the instantaneous throughput is maximized. The paper presents the related analysis, providing heuristic criteria for terminating the contention period and showing that very high throughputs can be achieved, even for a low number for contending users. The demonstrated results potentially have more direct practical implications compared to the approaches for coded random access that lead to high throughputs only asymptotically.},

Our candidate spacecraft is a 25 $\mu$m thick, 1 cm square silicon chip equipped with signal transmitting circuitry. This design reduces the total mass to less than 7.5 mg and enables the spacecraft bus itself to serve as a solar sail with characteristic acceleration on the order of 0.1 mm/s2. It is passive in that it maneuvers with no closed-loop actuation of orbital or attitude states. The unforced dynamics that result from an insertion orbit and a launch-vehicle separation determine its subsequent state evolution. We have developed a system architecture that uses solar radiation torques to maintain a sun-pointing heading and can be fabricated with standard microfabrication processes. This architecture has potential applications in heliocentric, geocentric, and three-body orbits.},

abstract = {In less than a decade, Cubesats have evolved from purely educational tools to a standard platform for technology demonstration and scientific instrumentation. The use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components and the ongoing miniaturization of several technologies have already led to scattered instances of missions with promising scientific value. Furthermore, advantages in terms of development cost and development time with respect to larger satellites, as well as the possibility of launching several dozens of Cubesats with a single rocket launch, have brought forth the potential for radically new mission architectures consisting of very large constellations or clusters of Cubesats. These architectures promise to combine the temporal resolution of GEO missions with the spatial resolution of LEO missions, thus breaking a traditional trade-off in Earth observation mission design. This paper assesses the current capabilities of Cubesats with respect to potential employment in Earth observation missions. A thorough review of Cubesat bus technology capabilities is performed, identifying potential limitations and their implications on 17 different Earth observation payload technologies. These results are matched to an exhaustive review of scientific requirements in the field of Earth observation, assessing the possibilities of Cubesats to cope with the requirements set for each one of 21 measurement categories. Based on this review, several Earth observation measurements are identified that can potentially be compatible with the current state-of-the-art of Cubesat technology although some of them have actually never been addressed by any Cubesat mission. Simultaneously, other measurements are identified which are unlikely to be performed by Cubesats in the next few years due to insuperable constraints. Ultimately, this paper is intended to supply a box of ideas for universities to design future Cubesat missions with high scientific payoff.},

abstract = {We design low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that perform at rates extremely close to the Shannon capacity. The codes are built from highly irregular bipartite graphs with carefully chosen degree patterns on both sides. Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds},

abstract = {In this letter, a reservation scheme with contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA), called R-CRDSA, is proposed. Although CRDSA promises excellent performance compared to slotted ALOHA (SA), there are two barriers to be overcome for its use in satellite networks. The first is a low critical point of an offered load; i.e., at this point, as the offered load increases, the throughput will decrease. CRDSA has a lower critical point than that of SA. The second barrier is that CRDSA has a lower capacity efficiency compared to SA; i.e., on average, CRDSA requires more power or bandwidth than SA for transmission. R-CRDSA can overcome these barriers at the same cost as CRDSA, especially for multi-packet messages. The analytic performances are derived by the observation of the transition between two successive frames, and the average number of packets in a message. The simulation results show that the analytic derivations are valid, and they confirm that the barriers are resolved by R-CRDSA.},

abstract = {It is shown how the methods of risk analysis have been used in the University of Rome micro-satellite program. One of the driving research topics related to this program is the reduction of cost in building spacecraft. The probability risk analysis techniques seem to be a powerful tool in the field of micro-satellites design, to outline possible faults. Innovation and limited budget forcing the designer to move in a very “risky” environment and can be faced with an as rigorous as possible decision making method. In our project, cost reduction is often attained relying on commercial, not space-rated components, which of course increases risk. This is why the design process should be led by the careful analysis of the risk associated with the selection of components and construction techniques. In standard applications risk can be evaluated from reliability data obtained in previous and well known similar applications. In our case, for many components, there is a lack of reliability data, due to the obvious missing experience when dealing with not yet space qualified, or even never flown before components. This lack is overcome using numerical simulations and practical engineering considerations, but does not allow a rigorous reliability assessment. A simple qualitative analysis is used to rank priorities among subsystems and allocate economic resources and development efforts. The main risk source is space radiation effect on CMOS electronic components. Therefore, development resources are directed to radiation effect mitigation. A procedure is proposed to lower risk without using space rated components.},

abstract = {The constraints on mass and size imposed on pico- and nanosatellites drive spacecraft designers to seek fabrication methods allowing a large degree of integration. From a configuration point of view, as sizes decrease the notion of subsystems vanishes, the structural interfaces become unique and need to be custom-made. This paper describes the integration concept of the SwissCube pico-satellite with special focus on the state-of-the art structural machining process. It also presents a new soldering technique for solar arrays. Both technologies are well suited for pico- to small- satellite applications and introduce flexibility in the design process. The first part will introduce the configuration of the SwissCube and present the advantages of wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) to manufacture the satellites primary structure. This technique, used for the SwissCube pico-satellite, has allowed the manufacture of a complex lightweight monoblock frame that serves as primary as well as secondary structure. The frame is one of the lightest in the CubeSat community while its rigidity is very high as shown by FEA and vibration tests. The second part will focus on a new bonding technique for solar arrays. So far the common technique for solar array bonding consisted of attaching solar cells with silicon or epoxy adhesives. In the frame of the SwissCube project, an innovative assembly approach of solar cells has been investigated. It consists of soldering solar cell on a printed circuit board panel with a process of brazing. Environmental tests have been successfully performed to evaluate the reliability of this process. Non destructives tests were also done to evaluate the quality of the solder pads.},

@article{CHU1997,
abstract = {The Global Positioning System or GPS has been developed for the purpose of enabling accurate positioning and navigation anywhere on or near the surface of the Earth. In addition to the US system GPS-NAVSTAR, the Russian GLONASS system is also in place and operational. Other such systems are under study. The key measurement involved is the time of travel of signals from a particular GPS spacecraft to the navigating receiver. Navigation accuracies of the order of tenths of meters are achievable, and accuracies at the centimeter level can also be obtained with special enhancement techniques. In recent years spacecraft have already been exploring the use of GPS for in-orbit navigation. As the receiver is solid state, rugged, power-lean, and cheap, GPS for autonomous navigation will be an objective even for low-cost spacecraft of only modest sophistication. When the GPS receiver is equipped with multiple antennas with baselines even as low as about one meter, it can also give attitude information. In this case, the position of the spacecraft needs to be known with only very moderate accuracy. However, the phase differences between signals received by the different antennas now constitute the key measurements. In this case a centimeter level accuracy of range difference can be obtained. Receivers carrying out the processing of such measurements are already on the market, even in space-qualified versions. For spacecraft maneuvering at low rates, accuracies of the order of tenths of a degree are achievable. There are reasons for maintaining classical attitude sensor suites on a spacecraft even when a GPS receiver is added. In this case the classical sensors may be allowed to be of modest quality only, as subsequent fusion of their data with those from the GPS receiver may restore the accuracy of the final estimate again to an acceptable level. Hence, low-cost attitude sensors combined with a low-cost GPS receiver can still satisfy non-trivial attitude reconstitution accuracy requirements. As carrier phase difference measurements are ambiguous because of the unknown number of GPS signal cycles received, the estimated attitude is in principle ambiguous as well. Therefore, resolution of the GPS signal cycle ambiguity becomes a necessary task before determining the attitude for a stand-alone GPS attitude sensing system. This problem may be solved by introducing additional low-cost reference attitude sensors like three-axis magnetometers. This is also one of the advantages of integrated sensor systems. The paper is organized as follows. Global Positioning System and GPS observables are described in the first two sections. The main attitude determination concepts are presented in the next section. For small spacecraft, GPS integrated with other low-cost attitude sensors results in a data fusion concept, to be discussed next. The last section highlights experiences and on-going projects related to the spacecraft attitude determination using GPS.},

While every researcher knows the few top-level venues for his specific fields of interest, a venue recommendation system may be a significant aid when starting to explore a new research field. We propose a venue recommendation system which requires only title and abstract, differently from previous works which require full-text and reference list: hence, our system can be used even in the early stages of the authoring process and greatly simplifies the building and maintenance of the knowledge base necessary for generating meaningful recommendations. We assessed our proposal using a standard metric on a dataset of more than 58000 papers: the results show that our method provides recommendations whose quality is aligned with previous works, while requiring much less information from both the paper and the knowledge base.},

abstract = {This paper presents design approaches to develop a reliable and efficient de-orbiting system for the 3USAT nanosatellite to provide a beneficial orbital decay process at the end of a mission. A de-orbiting system is initially designed by employing the aerodynamic drag augmentation principle where the structural constraints of the overall satellite system and the aerodynamic forces are taken into account. Next, an alternative de-orbiting system is designed with new considerations and further optimized using deterministic and reliability based design techniques. For the multi-objective design, the objectives are chosen to maximize the aerodynamic drag force through the maximization of the Kapton surface area while minimizing the de-orbiting system mass. The constraints are related in a deterministic manner to the required deployment force, the height of the solar panel hole and the deployment angle. The length and the number of layers of the deployable Kapton structure are used as optimization variables. In the second stage of this study, uncertainties related to both manufacturing and operating conditions of the deployable structure in space environment are considered. These uncertainties are then incorporated into the design process by using different probabilistic approaches such as Monte Carlo Simulation, the First-Order Reliability Method and the Second-Order Reliability Method. The reliability based design optimization seeks optimal solutions using the former design objectives and constraints with the inclusion of a reliability index. Finally, the de-orbiting system design alternatives generated by different approaches are investigated and the reliability based optimum design is found to yield the best solution since it significantly improves both system reliability and performance requirements.},

abstract = {Recent technological advancements have led to the emergence of a new miniaturized satellite platforms and this opened up the path for a whole new range of applications. The Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR) project is one of these applications, and aims to develop a low-frequency radio telescope for the 0.3 MHz to 30 MHz band. It uses a swarm of 50 or more identical nano-satellites to synthesize a very large aperture to explore the ultra-long electromagnetic (EM) waves in this frequency band. The swarm will act similar to a wireless sensor network (WSN) that samples the cosmic noise, processes the data in a distributed manner, and then sends the data to a base station (BS) for further processing and analysis. The satellites will have a very simple architecture (characteristic of a WSN node) that will focus on three main functionalities: radio observation, data processing, and distribution (inter-satellite and downlink). However, the complexity of the application results in strict requirements for the design of the satellites components, especially for the antenna systems. Starting from OLFAR's requirements and limitations, three separate antenna systems for scientific observation, inter-satellite link (ISL) and data downlink are designed and integrated into a nano-satellite platform.},

abstract = {A 3-D digital prototype printer has been considered for direct digital manufacturing of components because this technology has many benefits compared to conventional manufacturing technologies. In order to assess the applicability of the direct digital fabrication to a critical structural component, mechanical properties of the digitally fabricated component should meet the design or performance requirements. Furthermore, it is necessary to be able to predict the mechanical properties of the fabricated component based on the input parameters of the 3-D digital printer. The present project measured the mechanical properties (i.e. strength and stiffness) of samples fabricated from a 3-D digital printer as a function of processing parameters, determined predictive model connecting the input parameters to the 3-D digital printer and mechanical properties of the fabricated samples by using a statistical design of experiments and multivariate regression, validated the model using crush-strength experiments on the NPS CubeSat structure, and to hosted the CubeSat challenge.},

abstract = {The gain of circularly polarised (CP) array antennas realised by proper phasing of sequentially rotated linearly polarised (LP) elements is compared to that of arrays using CP elements and demonstrated by calculations for microstrip patch elements. When element spacing is large and array size is small, the advantages of LP elements are offset by the significant reduction in gain due to high cross polarised lobes in the diagonal planes. For large arrays of closely spaced elements, this gain loss reduces to a negligible amount. However, for spacings above a critical value of about 0.7 wavelengths, unacceptably high gain losses will be incurred.},

abstract = {The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) has a new requirement to support high-data-rate Category A (Cat A) missions (within 2 million kilometers of the Earth) with simultaneous S-band uplink, S-band downlink and Ka-band downlink. The S-band links are required for traditional telemetry, tracking {\&} command (TT{\&}C) support to the spacecraft, while the Ka-band link is intended for high-data-rate science returns. The new Ka-band system combines the use of proven DSN cryogenic designs, for low system temperature, and high-data-rate capability using commercial telemetry receivers. The initial Cat A support is required for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2014 and possibly other missions. The upgrade has been implemented into 3 different 34-meter Beam Waveguide (BWG) antennas in the DSN, one at each of the complexes in Canberra (Australia), Goldstone (California) and Madrid (Spain). System test data are presented to show that the requirements were met and the DSN is ready for Cat A Ka-band operational support.},

abstract = {The form of access-to-space for NASA space missions is often dictated before they are designed. Typically, solicitations specify the form - i.e., the launch vehicle to be used. The investigator then tries to design a mission within the given form and cost limits. This study adopts a more pragmatic point of view: that the form of access should follow from the function of the mission. Given the function, the form of space access is then optimized. The functions of a broad range of space technology experiments and current forms of space technology experiments and current forms of space access were analyzed. Results show that there might be a more effective approach to access-to-space.},

@article{Escobar2016,
abstract = {This paper studies the use of artificial evolution to automate the design of a satellite passive thermal control system. This type of adaptation often requires the use of computer simulations to evaluate fitness of a large number of candidate solutions. Simulations are required to be expedient and accurate so that solutions can be successfully transferred to reality. We explore a design process that involves three steps. On a first step candidate solutions (implemented as surface paint tiling patterns) are tested using a FEM model and ranked according to their quality to meet mission temperature requirements. On a second step the best individual is implemented as a real physical satellite mockup and tested inside a vacuum chamber, having light sources imitating the effect of solar light. On a third step the simulation model is adapted with data obtained during the real evaluation. These updated models can be further employed for continuing genetic search. Current differences between our simulation and our real physical setup are in the order of 1.45 °K mean squared error for faces pointing toward the light source and 2.4 °K mean squared errors for shadowed faces. We found that evolved tiling patterns can be 5°K below engineered patterns and 8 °K below using unpainted aluminum satellite surfaces.},

The equivalent circuit at and near the resonance with perturbations is obtained and the condition for circularly polarized antennas is found from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints.
